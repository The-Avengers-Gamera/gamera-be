That''ll certainly be true for Company of Heroes 3, because while the single-player campaigns are trapped in a quagmire of a strategic map and bogged down in their storytelling, in multiplayer we can focus on what really matters: moment-to-moment gameplay, balance, and faction mechanics.

It presents shockingly little reason for its own existence compared to the previous version, which came out almost eight years ago.

    'Writing this review hurt my feelings. The Company of Heroes series is near and dear to my heart â€“ all three of them are real-time strategy games that cut to the core of the genre, focusing on overarching strategic decisions coupled with tactical troop movements and a battlefield that truly matters. I''m pleased to say that Company of Heroes 3 implements those series fundamentals quite well in a gentle remix that brings the series to diverse theaters of World War 2 that it hadn''t touched yet. What I''m very displeased about is that the ambitious Italian campaign mode is incredibly disappointing. While individual missions and scenarios within the strategic sandbox are strong and even thrilling at times, almost every feature on the strategic map doesn''t work, either because it''s bugged or because it''s such middle-of-the-road game design that it''s simply boring.'),
