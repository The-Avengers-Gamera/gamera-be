'Nintendo Thinks Its First $70 Game Will Be Worth It', 
'<p>In today''s Daily Fix:<br>Nintendo of America''s president, Doug Bowser, believes their first $70 game will be worth the price. Via the Associated Press, Bowser said "I think fans will find this is an incredibly full, deeply immersive experience. The price point reflects the type of experience that fans can expect when it comes to playing this particular game." But for Nintendo fans worried about shelling out 70 bucks for all their first-party games, fear not. Bowser said this isn''t necessarily going to be the price for every game. According to him, it''s fairly common in Europe and other parts of the world to vary the price depending on the game. In other news, it seems like IO Interactive is full speed ahead on their James Bond 007 game, and confirmed that any new Hitman games are on pause at the moment. And speaking of game delays, the System Shock remake has been pushed back a couple of months.</p>',

'Quentin Tarantino''s Final Movie Revealed in New Report',
'<p>We finally have the first details on what will reportedly be Quentin Tarantino''s final movie.</p>
<p>According to a report in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/quentin-tarantino-sets-the-movie-critic-final-movie-1235351260/?fbclid=IwAR2fE63osOpsgdpLHeYglHzrMzqIA5ZQliz2e-Xuxr2a5SqIVFKBfnl-HDA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THR </a>today, it will be titled The Movie Critic, and Tarantino has already written the script. He plans to direct the film in the fall.</p>
<p>Sources also tell THR that it will officially be his final movie, and that it will center on a woman in late ''70s Los Angeles. There isn''t currently a studio attached to fund and distribute but it could go out to buyers reportedly as early as this week.</p>
<p>IGN has reached out to Tarantino''s reps for comment. Chatter over what will be Tarantino''s final directorial project has run rampant for years now - however, there''s good reason to believe that this will finally be it. </p>
<p>The filmmaker behind movies like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Inglourious Basterds, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has <a href="/articles/2016/11/04/quentin-tarantino-confirms-his-tenth-film-will-be-his-last">previously, repeatedly said</a> that his tenth movie would be his last - and, although he''s already <em>technically</em> made ten films as of 2019, he considers Parts 1 and 2 of Kill Bill to be one movie. So, by Tarantino''s math, this <em>would </em>be his tenth film.</p>
<p>He re-affirmed that his next movie would be his last as recently as last year, telling <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/entertainment/quentin-tarantino-movie-10-last-one-hollywood-film/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, "I''ve been doing it for a long time; I''ve been doing it for 30 years. And it''s time to wrap up the show."</p>
<p>Tarantino made his directorial debut in 1992 with Reservoir Dogs, and would go on to become one of the most influential modern filmmakers. His most recent movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won two.</p>

'Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon Review',
'<p>What if I told you Bayonetta wasn’t always the confident, ass-kicking witch we’ve known for all these years? That unexplored history is what Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon shines a light on, painting a thoughtful picture of a time when the scariest monsters a young Bayonetta had to face were her own inner demons. This spin-off puts the usual wild stylish action aside for a whimsical and harrowing adventure brimming with childlike wonder and genuinely heartwarming moments. It’s a fascinating side of the Bayonetta world we’ve never seen before, and one that leaves me with a deeper appreciation for a series I already loved.</p>
<p>There’s so much to adore in Bayonetta Origins that I was smiling from ear to ear, giggling from all the charming gags, or exclaiming “Aww!” more times than I can count. Every corner of it is brought to life with a beautiful storybook presentation to frame the action-adventure thrills. It’s such a joyous journey in an imaginative world, steeped in Irish mythology, where faeries have trapped Cereza in the labyrinthine Avalon Forest and lurk about with tricks and ambushes. It also explores elements only alluded to in the mainline games with a grounded and earnest approach. Yet, it’s distinct enough as a prequel to stand on its own merits so newcomers can jump in and thoroughly enjoy. And after its roughly 15-hour journey, I was left a bit sad when it came time to close the book on it.</p>
<p>Taking more of a top-down view than Bayonetta’s usual third-person camera, Bayonetta Origins simultaneously puts you in control of both Cereza and her demon-infused cat plushie, Cheshire, when summoned — Cereza’s movement and actions are dedicated to the left side of the controller and Cheshire to the right. Juggling two characters eventually became quite intuitive once I got the hang of it, but I found both the system itself and the challenges it’s used for don’t evolve drastically after being established. You’ll become familiar with the pattern of using one character to move part of the environment or pin down an enemy to setup the other, but these moments can still lead to some neat mind-bending scenarios by virtue of the coordination required to handle the tandem effectively. </p>
<p>In one respect, Bayonetta Origins is a puzzle-platformer that often asks you to analyze your surroundings and figure out how to use the duo’s abilities to get through it. Cheshire can pull objects with his chameleon-like vine tongue, block projectiles with his hardened stone skin, or propel lily pads with a jetstream to navigate water, all of which help get Cereza where she needs to go. These elemental skills are gained over the course of the story, which does introduce a few wrinkles to the formula to keep it feeling fresh. Cereza herself has a fun little rhythm minigame with Witch Pulse where she gleefully ballet dances to make various objects come alive and open the paths ahead. While these platforming puzzles never get too complex, there’s an enjoyable variety to exploring this wondrous world.</p>
<p>In another respect, Bayonetta Origins is a proper action game, with combat that has the duo working together in a similar fashion. Cereza’s main purpose is to trap enemies in place with Thorn Bind, giving Cheshire the opportunity to freely wail on dastardly faeries with furious swipes and powerful smashes. A variety of enemy types gradually encouraged me to mix up Cheshire’s elemental modes, such as ripping shields and throwing them back with his grass ability or casting a massive area-of-effect explosion with his fire combo. It’s not necessarily as nuanced as I’d expect from a mainline Bayonetta game, but landing attacks always has a satisfying crunch, like there’s a beastly weight and impact behind every hit. And when you finally finish off the last few enemies with Cheshire’s chunky chomps, the dazzling art style and lively animations jump from the screen to celebrate in a way that feels like its own reward.</p>
<p>Bayonetta Origins is a rather forgiving game, tricky from the perspective of managing two characters at once yet not particularly difficult overall. However, several of the Tír na nÓg trials scattered across the world do provide intriguing puzzle and combat sequences in otherworldly stages built to test your skill and reward you with items and collectibles. The story-critical Tír na nÓg are fun and fairly straightforward, but the optional ones are really worth seeking out — if not for the gratification of clearing the map alone, then definitely for the enjoyable challenges they offer. For example, in one Cereza and Cheshire have to run separately along parallel paths while avoiding different sets of deadly obstacles, while another had Cheshire in a hamster wheel to move platforms or block lasers to help Cereza progress. No matter what they have you do, ending each one with a Witch Pulse dance and a colorful burst of energy to break the ethereal realm never gets old.</p>
<p>Boss fights also have some great one-off mechanics of their own that play into their unique quirks. One such battle takes place in a circus against a trickster faerie you have to trap with Cereza so that Cheshire can send a cannonball into them, capping the fight off with classic Bayonetta-style quick time events to blast the boss into oblivion and frame the climactic moment. Defeating the fabled Jabberwock was another triumphant moment for Cereza and Cheshire, an imposing dragon that requires timing, teamwork, and clever environmental interactions to take down — it’s a turning point that proved this pair can be stronger together and overcome anything. Many of these big battles pull you deeper into the pages of this storybook world for memorable moments and awesome surprises.</p>
<div style="color: red; font-size: 2.125rem; margin: 4px 0; line-height: 1.12; font-weight: 900;">More than anything, this is a coming of age tale for Cereza.<div style="color: red"><hr><span>“</span></div></div>',

'John Wick: Chapter 4 Review',
'<p>From the moment the Baba Yaga first dropped a gold coin in front of Charon at The Continental, the John Wick series established an instantly fascinating mythology: a global chessboard where an archaic code pits those of service to the villainous High Table against those looking to suplex 300-pound bodyguards through that very table. In Chapter 4 of this story, John Wick’s vendetta has forced the Table into open warfare, and it thrives on John’s acceptance of the fact that even he can’t win that war on his own. The rules and consequences the John Wick universe has taken such care to establish provide its fourth chapter a rock-solid structure that allows for director Chad Stahelski and star Keanu Reeves to stage an symphony of onscreen action, with every component driving to elevate the others. It is the longest John Wick movie. It is the <em>most</em> John Wick movie. And it is the best John Wick movie.</p>
<p>An early maneuver on John’s part forces the High Table past the point of no return: Wick must be made an example of, and that task falls to Bill Skarsgård’s very willing Marquis de Gramont. With Skarsgård, the John Wick universe gets its first supervillain. As the High Table’s emissary, he drips entitlement and hypocrisy with each <em>very</em> French-accented word he purrs. In contrast to Chapter 2’s Santino D’Antonio, whose primary leverage over John was personal (an unpaid blood debt), the sadist Marquis wields the authority of the High Table like a dandy Darth Vader, and the cruelties in which he indulges go a long way towards making him an ideal foil to John and his cohorts. The High Table bureaucracy has long hidden behind intermediaries like Winston (Ian McShane) and The Adjudicator, and Skarsgard does a great job of embodying the decadence and rot that permeates the organization with increasing severity the higher up the ladder you go. </p>
<p>Chapter 4 firmly cements John Wick as standing shoulder to shoulder with The Matrix’s Neo as part of Keanu Reeves’ nearly unparalleled action hero lineup. The raw-nerved rage of the freshly widowed Wick that wowed in the original movie has progressed into something even more deadly: resolve and focus. Reeves conveys these qualities with practiced restraint, so complete here that the occasional one-liners or subtly raised eyebrow come off as authentic to the character and not beholden to representing any cliches of the genre… sometimes if you bake your cake well enough, you get to eat it, too. </p>
<p>Reeves’ (not to mention Stahelski’s) contributions to The Matrix’s success can’t be overstated, but the Wick films have always felt like more personal celebrations of the actor’s dedication to the craft of highly choreographed action. The pure thrill of seeing John Wick’s continuing battle to reclaim his soul work so well is doubly gratifying when you consider it as the labor of love it clearly is for Reeves.</p>
<div style="color: red; font-size: 2.125rem; margin: 4px 0; line-height: 1.12; font-weight: 900;">Of all the excellent additions to the cast, Donnie Yen’s Caine stands apart.<div class="quote-divider"><hr><span>“</span></div></div>
<p>John Wick may be the namesake of the franchise, but his journey has increasingly emphasized the importance of social contracts and shared history. That investment fully blossoms with Chapter 4’s Murderer’s Row of John Wick characters. Winston, Charon (Lance Reddick), and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) serve as John’s counsel, and while Reddick and Fishburne’s presence is limited to only a few scenes, their impact is maximized thanks to those performers’ signature gravitas and command of their characters. Despite having shot John off the roof of the Continental at the end of Chapter 3 (something no one’s got any hard feelings over; that’s like accidentally tripping someone in this world) Winston continues in his role as a surrogate father to John, and McShane’s characteristic confidence both bolsters the myth of John Wick and maintains the Continental manager’s reputation of being the smoothest operator in the game. </p>
<p>Of all the excellent new additions to the cast, Donnie Yen’s Caine stands apart. An imposing antagonist introduced as a longtime contemporary of Wick’s, the blind assassin’s reluctance to enforce The Marquis’ orders without question echoes John’s rejection of his own call to “serve and be of service.” That parallel adds a surprising amount of empathy to their encounters, but it doesn’t keep Caine from going after John with everything he has. Yen’s affable demeanor and brutal efficiency give his flavor of the series’ “Gun Fu” a lightness and style all its own, and Caine’s wild ingenuity in battle leads to delightful, laugh-out-loud finishers. </p>
<p>Also in the mix is Shamier Anderson’s unnamed Tracker, an operative who bears the heavy burden of <em>having a dog in a John Wick movie.</em> Tracker’s shifting allegiances, combat skills, and close relationship to his canine companion provide a nice, simmering paranoia for Chapter 4 to employ when a wildcard is needed to spice up Wick’s progress. There’s also Klaus, and I just need to shout that dude out. I know two things about him: he’s a big boy and his name is Klaus. His involvement takes up less time than you’ve spent reading about him here, but I promise he’s both unmissable and unforgettable.</p>
<p>In an age of increased grumbling about films with two-plus-hour runtimes, Chapter 4’s roaring pace serves as a counter argument that proclaims movies should be<em> as long as they need to be. </em>Over the course of three Wick chapters, director Chad Stahelski has developed a keen sense of when to speed John through a room full of heavies with surgical precision and when to let him and those of us watching luxuriate in the carnage he can unleash in more intimate encounters. Stahelski’s attention to detail across every element of the action in Chapter 4 is appreciable, and well-communicated by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch’s script.</p>
<div style="color: red;font-size: 2.125rem;margin: 4px 0;line-height: 1.12;font-weight: 900;">I hope you came hungry for neck shots,becauseyou’ll be leaving well-fed.<div class="quote-divider"><hr><span>“</span></div></div>
<p>For instance, it’s established early on that the High Table forces that are now coming after John wear impenetrable body armor from head to toe – which yes, sounds like something out of a video game. But Stahelski pays that off through action, not dialogue, as the armored foes force Wick to adjust his traditional strategy of shooting people in whatever part of their body was asking for it most. I hope you came hungry for neck shots, because you’ll be leaving Chapter 4 well-fed. Similarly, the droll introduction of homemade incendiary rounds is established in a throwaway line of dialogue… one which will very likely instantly resurface in your mind the first time an unlucky thug gets obliterated by one. To call a movie that’s nearly three hours long “economical” may sound contradictory, but nothing established in Chapter 4 goes to waste. </p>
<p>The High Table’s lengthy siege of the Osaka Continental may just be the single best action sequence in the John Wick films to date – and this is a series that has already outdone nearly every other contender in that category. Stahelski balances multiple perspectives on the assault expertly, and sustains the momentum of each character’s efforts through the extended bloodbath. Chapter 3 gave us a taste of what happens when a Continental manager crosses the Table, but as Winston’s counterpart in cool, Hiroyuki Sanada’s Koji Shimazu faces their full wrath with unwavering conviction. </p>
<p>Stahelski uses Shimazu’s relationship with his daughter Akira (Rina Samayawa) to underline what morality looks like in a world full of killers, and Sanada is just as impressive in their tender father-daughter moments as he is with a blade in hand. What makes the Osaka sequence even more satisfying is how it reinforces Chapter 4’s friendship theme: Wick doesn’t try to escape the Table with any great speed or stealth; he’s going for maximum damage, and only because he knows that he’s responsible for bringing this mess to his friend’s doorstep. The action’s close tie to John’s interior condition is wonderfully demonstrated later in a sickeningly stressful chase and fight around the Arc de Triomphe, deployed when John is at his most harried. The most effective action sequences in films also reflect and reinforce character, and Chapter 4 never forgets that. </p>
<p>For a series which has always looked stylish as hell, Chapter 4 sets a new standard for production design and cinematography. Locations across Osaka, Paris, Berlin, and New York have distinctive architectural qualities which allow director of photography Dan Laustsen varied opportunities to wash characters in the series’ iconic candy-colored neon hues. The Osaka Continental’s hyper-modern light installations, Paris’ warm streetlamps, a Manhattan sunset cutting through a story-tall bank of shades in the Marquis’ office all give each movement of the story a quickly readable palette that bestows each city a unique visual identity and makes sure we always know exactly where John is. That’s all complimented by a punchy score from Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard, which traces Chapter 4’s movements from culture to culture and converses with the action in ways that alternatingly emphasize and undercut big moments to great effect.</p>',

'Konami Acknowledges ''Excitement and Enthusiasm'' for More Castlevania Amid Dead Cells DLC Launch', 
'<p>Much like its bloodsucking antagonist, Castlevania has lain dormant for many years, but Konami''s classic vampire-slaying franchise is finally beginning to awaken thanks to projects like Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Released earlier this week, the heralded DLC stars Richter Belmont and Alucard in what Konami Return to Castlevania supervisor Tsutomu Taniguchi half-jokingly refers to as an isekai — slang for anime about characters suddenly being transported into a new and unfamiliar world.</p>
  <p>"Is ''isekai'' a buzzword ? Because this is how I would define this storyline," Taniguchi told IGN in a new interview. "Let''s just say that Dracula''s Castle teleported on the Beheaded''s Island and what happened on the island stays on the island."</p>
  <p>No, Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania isn''t canon, but it is a fun reimagining of the old-school platformer, which got its start on the Famicom way back in 1986. The DLC has been heralded by fans and critics alike, with IGN''s review calling it a <a href="/articles/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-dlc-review">"shining blueprint of how to do a crossover right."</a>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>''Respectfully stolen''</h2>
  <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/05/21/top-10-konami-slide-show-cover2-1590088496796.jpg?crop=16%3A9&width=888&dpr=2">
  <p>According to Evil Empire chief operating officer Benjamin Laulan, it got its start at 2019''s BitSummit festival in Kyoto, which the studio attended in the hope of making a deal to sell Dead Cells in the Japanese market. A meeting with Konami convinced Laulan to shoot his shot and pitch a crossover, and was surprised to find a receptive audience.</p>
  <p>"Back in France, we started working on it and well, since Dead Cells had ''respectfully stolen'' so many elements from the series already, such as: the whip, the key art with the castle, the food hidden in walls… the ''rogue-vania'' punchline… (oops!) It just made sense to continue this way, so we got lost into excitement and went all-in, the pitch quickly turned into a full DLC proposition," Laulan said.</p>
  <p>Laulan called Empire''s collaboration "really, really smooth," saying Konami readily agreed to everything from Richter Mode to the Konami Code.</p>
  <p>Taniguchi, for his part, said that Konami is "proud" that Castlevania had such an impact on Dead Cells.</p>
  <p>"Seriously, knowing that Dead Cells, which is among the greatest indie games of the past ten years, was inspired by Castlevania is a huge source of pride for us," he said. "When Evil Empire and Motion Twin came back with their full-DLC proposition instead of just this short featuring we weren’t really surprised and we were hoping for that to be honest. And we just thought we had to let them go full circle, because we knew they would use every ounce of their talent to honor the franchise. And also, I personally admit I just really wanted to see what a fight against Dracula in Dead Cells would look like!"</p>
  <h2>''We know that our fans always want more''</h2>
  <p>Taniguchi wouldn''t say what the Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania means for the broader franchise, which hasn''t seen a proper release since <a href="/articles/2014/02/25/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2-review">2014''s Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</a> (the successful Netflix series aside), but did acknowledge the "excitement and enthusiasm of the fans online," which is "really motivating for [Konami]." </p>
  <p>"We tried to bring back the games that people loved and cherished with the Castlevania Anniversary Collection and the Castlevania Advance Collection, we also brought back Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night for our PlayStation fans and on mobile, and launched Grimoire of Souls on Apple Arcade to celebrate the lore of the franchise," Taniguchi said. "But we know that our fans always want more, and we do too, so this opportunity to have this amazing crossover with Dead Cells was impossible to pass up on. "</p>
  <p>Konami is a long way from its glory days, when franchises like Metal Gear Solid and Castlevania towered over the games industry, but there are signs of a comeback. Konami is currently working on multiple Silent Hill projects, including a <a href="/articles/bloober-team-ceo-silent-hill-2-interview-piotr-babieno">full-blown remake of Silent Hill 2</a>, and <a href="/articles/metal-gear-solid-castlevania-silent-sequel-new-game-konami">rumors of a Metal Gear Solid remake persist.</a> Even Suikoden is getting a little love with <a href="/articles/suikoden-1-and-2-konami-cult-classic-rpgs-remaster-collection">a remaster set for later this year</a>. </p>
  <p>Will Castlevania follow suit? We''ll just have to see. But in the short-term, Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is a tantalizing reminder of what could be for one of Konami''s most beloved franchises.</p>', 'NEWS', 'Konami''s classic vampire-slaying franchise is slowly coming back to life.', '2023-03-13 00:23:59.355576+00', '2023-03-13 00:23:59.355576+00'),

  <p></p>
  <p>Earlier this week, people <a href="/articles/soulslike-game-bleak-faith-forsaken-accused-of-using-elden-ring-and-other-fromsoftware-animations">noticed that the game utilized very similar animations</a> for its characters and enemies from FromSoftware games and accused the Archangel Studios of reusing them. </p>
  <p>“Since the start of development, Archangel Studios has always been transparent with their community about the use of Epic Marketplace assets. While only 10% of the game has been outsourced in this manner, it has helped speed up the development process immensely,” Archangel Studios explained in a statement to IGN. </p>
  <p>It continued, “As a three-person studio, it was a vital resource to utilize throughout the four-year development. The assets in question were purchased from the Epic Marketplace in good faith and with the understanding that Epic went through the proper vetting and review process before listing them for sale.”</p>

  <p>The studio also said that it had reached out to Epic Games about an investigation, to which it then responded, “Pursuant to the Marketplace Distribution Agreement, each Marketplace seller represents and warrants to Epic that they have appropriate rights to upload their content. As with any store that hosts third-party content, however, Epic is not in a position to independently verify such rights, and Epic makes no such guarantee to purchasers of the content.”</p>
  <p>Archangel Studios noted that the assets that it had used for Bleak Faith have since been removed from the Unreal Engine marketplace. The development team has also removed all of these animations from Bleak Faith, stating that Epic’s answer wasn’t satisfactory and will work to replace the assets over the next few days.</p>
  <p>“Some changes we included in the recent patches, and more are coming in the next few days,” the studio said. “Certainly this has been a huge lesson for us and hopefully other indie creators out there too that assets on these storefronts seemingly cannot be purchased in good faith.”</p>

'Among Us VR Review', 
'<p>Among Us VR understands what made Innersloth’s murder mystery game so special when it came out in 2018 and brought us near-endless shenanigans by placing 10 people inside a spaceship while two Impostors try to murder everyone. This ground-up VR remake is a refreshing take on the premise that recaptures that suspense while introducing exciting new dynamics. Though its missing features may prove disappointing, what’s here is a great time. Right now, it’s one of this year’s best VR games.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It’s hard to overstate just how polished Among Us VR feels when playing. Schell Games has adapted it to virtual reality well: the cel-shaded 3D art style works to great effect, and switching to first-person gameplay proves natural. Walking around a recreation of The Skeld spaceship map and using motion controls to carry out tasks feels a lot more immersive, and fuelling engines with a manual pump and priming shields by touching the screen is more intuitive than using a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. You can play comfortably while standing or sitting down, since movement is entirely smooth and controlled by the thumbsticks. There’s no teleporting, but if you’re concerned about motion sickness, optional blinders are available to reduce potential nausea risk, alongside snap turning for the camera. </p>
  <p>Among Us VR faithfully recreates the original’s template, and once again splits us between Crewmates and Impostors. Within a four to 10-player online match, Crewmates must complete several randomly assigned tasks across The Skeld. Some tasks aren’t particularly exciting, like waiting around for a data transfer, and the real joy comes from the social gameplay surrounding it. Still, there’s several new tasks that make creative use of VR: the Admin room has a new retinal scanner that requires you to stand still for a few moments, which isn’t terribly exciting, though MedBay’s whack-a-mole mini-game is entertaining.</p>
  <p>As an Impostor, though, your only goal is convincing everyone that you’re just another Crewmate, even as you’re deviously killing other crewmates and trying to get away with it. There are plenty of creative avenues for murder, such as jamming doors or causing a blackout (knowing that Impostors can see in the dark). Or you can go big by sabotaging the ship by depleting the oxygen or causing a reactor meltdown, which are instant wins if Crewmates leave them unfixed for too long. I felt more creeped out during blackouts, and there’s a greater sense of panic when the blaring red lights appear during a sabotage.</p>
  <p>Once a dead body’s been discovered, an emergency meeting commences and the real game of trickery and detective work begins. If you’re a real Crewmate, you have to figure out who the Imposters are using whatever suspicious activities you might’ve witnessed and decide who can be trusted. If you’re an Imposter, you state your innocence, cast blame on others, and try to get others to vote with you to buy someone else a one-way ticket to space. Even after years of playing, keeping your story straight and successfully pinning the kill on someone else still feels great, and it’s only enhanced by VR. Being falsely ejected through no fault of your own can be frustrating, never mind getting caught out as an Impostor by sheer bad luck, but the fun of this game of cat and mouse is in picking up on subtle clues or tricking everyone with clever hints and insinuations. There’s a cooldown before you can strike again, which keeps a skilled Imposter from running amok. As always, how well a social game like this works comes down to who you''re playing with, but in VR there’s a greater sense of presence when everyone’s staring at you.</p>
  <p>That’s all true of the regular version of Among Us, but simply having in-built voice chat in everybody’s headset solves one of that version’s biggest problems: if you’re using an external voice client like Discord dead people can still talk and use that to cheat, but here they become mute ghosts upon death. Plus, having everybody able to speak immediately makes emergency meetings a highlight of Among Us VR. The use of proximity heightens tension: Knowing that someone’s voice gets louder as you get closer is another way to gather evidence, and introduces a fresh dynamic to matches whether you’re hunting or being hunted. Also, you can ask someone to watch you get scanned in MedBay to prove your innocence without necessarily alerting an Impostor to your location. If you’re an Impostor, you can try hiding in vents and eavesdropping on other crewmates’ conversations. Voice chat also makes calling someone out in the middle of a lie and seeing that so-called “Crewmate” crumble under pressure even more thoroughly satisfying. And if voice chat’s not for you for whatever reason, there’s also a text chat system that uses predetermined quick-chat messages. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>There’s a lot Among Us VR does right, but the biggest knock against this version is that it doesn’t have all of the same content and features as standard Among Us. That’s understandable in places, since changing gameplay settings like giving yourself faster walking speed would be a nauseating disaster for a lot of people. However, it would be nice to be able to adjust the number of tasks, for instance. Cosmetics are also limited at launch, and while the Steve Zissou-esque beanie is nice, it’s no double top hat. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>What stings more is Among Us VR’s lack of extra maps. At launch, there’s no Mira HQ, Polus, or the Airship – all we have to play with is The Skeld. In fairness, this was also the case when Among Us launched but a lot of people may not realise that because those maps arrived before it really took off in popularity. As a result, what’s here feels disappointingly scaled back compared to the current state of Among Us. You also won’t find the XP system, anonymous voting, or expanded roles like Scientists and Shapeshifters. Schell Games says content updates are coming but right now, we don’t know what or when. Still, Among Us VR’s real longevity comes down to who you''re playing with. I couldn’t play with friends during this review, but even in a lobby full of strangers, I had an excellent time. The good news is that there’s crossplay multiplayer between Quest 2 and PC, which is a reassuring choice given VR’s smaller audience. </p>',

'GOD OF WAR: RAGNAROK', 
' <p>How do you follow up on one of the greatest video games of all time? Sony Santa Monica finds itself in a situation not dissimilar to when Francis Ford Coppola created the sequel to his mob movie masterpiece, The Godfather. Like part two of the Corleone story, God of War Ragnarok puts a fierce, younger member of the family directly under the microscope. In doing so it manages to reach the heights of its predecessor and, in some ways, even tower above it. The writing, performances, and music are each exceptional, bringing this expansive Norse tapestry to life – but even as it holds your heart in one hand with its elegantly told story it’s crunching bones in the other with fantastically ferocious combat. It all binds together to forge a monumental action epic that adds yet another impressive landmark to the video game landscape.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Keeping things broad and spoiler-free, Kratos'' story picks up a few years after the final revelations of 2018''s God of War – this is absolutely not one of those sequels where everything will make sense without playing the first game, or at the very least watching the included story recap (which is probably too brief to serve as anything but a jolt to the memory). The apocalyptic Ragnarok is coming, and its events circle around his son Atreus like one of Odin''s ravens. Fimbulwinter – a time of unrest that presages Ragnarok – has very much come and, during the intervening years, Atreus has been growing stronger, learning about his Giant name "Loki", and trying to convince his father to trust him. There are touching callbacks to the hunting scene from the 2018 God of War as Kratos proudly watches Atreus prove that he’s no longer a child. But it’s no slow introduction: Ragnarok wastes no time in stepping into the action and, after a breakneck opening battle, the first step of this new journey is to leave the frozen realm of Midgard and find a missing Norse god in the broader and varied universe.</p>
  <p>It may not be as tightly told a story as 2018''s, but Ragnarok has much grander designs. This is a sprawling epic that always keeps things on the move without ever becoming disorientating, gluing me to the edge of my seat as it repeatedly toyed with expectations. It''s an ambition regularly met by stunning execution, with a momentum that never slips as you hurtle towards its bombastic ending. This journey took me just over 28 hours with a few fair side quests completed along the way, but with plenty still left to do afterward.</p>
  <p>Prophecy and sacrifice swirl at the story’s centre as it repeatedly prods at the concept of destiny and whether blood runs thicker than the ink that pens it. It doesn’t merely offer up surface-level readings of these themes; instead, each character and their motives are given the respect they deserve by delving in deep. It’s a truly special and fittingly grand conclusion of Kratos’ Norse saga, as well as providing resolution to some of his more troubled Greek memories.</p>
 
  <p>God of War’s combat has always been the flashy attraction that draws a crowd in to be wowed by its story, however, and Ragnarok continues that tradition. It may seem familiar at first – and indeed some things remain the same – but it isn''t afraid to play with expectations and throw a curveball your way. Kratos’ blades whip around in every direction, delivering a clanking firey pain to any face they meet. Heavy cleaves of his axe crunch into enemies, making them fold like bloodied origami. And yes, that axe still slices through the air, meatily lodging itself into anything unfortunate enough to be in its path, before being recalled to your palm with a hearty kick from the DualSense controller’s haptics in what remains one of the most satisfying button presses ever assigned to a controller. It''s all unapologetically fast, and undeniably glorious – harking back to the brand of frantic action in which the series was originally rooted.</p>
  <p>There’s a fair helping of excessive violence on show, with Kratos willfully impaling and ripping apart any enemy put in front of him. Arenas are often tight spaces full of threats, and though you aren’t going to see the return of dozens of enemies on screen at once that spawn in wave after wave, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some aspects of those older games shining through. But even with that slight shift to old-school action, Ragnarok’s eyes are still drawn more to the shimmer of Nathan Drake''s gold rather than Bayonetta''s platinum. Cinematic spectacle takes precedence over the chaotic, bordering-on cartoonish action of old. </p>
  <p>The axe feels largely similar to how you remember (and that’s no bad thing) with its dynamic mix of heavy attacks and ranged power, but how you wield the blades is noticeably different. There''s a greater emphasis on using them to hook enemies and maneuver them around the arena – whether that be dragging them in towards you or juggling them in the air like the hottest of potatoes. They''re much closer to how they felt in the original games; a nostalgic move set with a brilliant modern edge. The action feels and looks outstanding and there are no caveats or exceptions when I say that Ragnarok is only an improvement over God of War’s already ferocious combat. </p>
  <p>Realms old and new are regularly a sight to behold – many looking torn from the pages of fairy tales, stocked with oversized flora and fauna. There''s an extra effort to delve deeper into the mythology this time around and, as someone who''s a fan of the Nordic source material, it''s a real pleasure to see all of the different interpretations of creatures, people, and places they inhabit brought to life in all manner of delightfully weird ways. </p>
  <p>The dwarven city of Nidavellir is a welcome rural change of scenery, with its many homes and tunnels that Kratos must amusingly crawl around in. It''s at the centre of the rocky realm of Svartalfheim, where waterways weave through islets littered with bubbling geysers. There’s a real sense that the realm was ripped right out of the Old Norse Poetic Edda’s home of Iceland. Those geysers are also key to solving many of the puzzles in the region as you freeze them to create stepping stones and manipulate machinery – quirks like this help in making each place feel unique. </p>
  <p>Similarly, fun new ideas are introduced in the returning Alfheim, such as reflective crystals that you can ricochet your axe off of to open doors or even use to blindside unwitting opponents in combat. It''s a further example of not only each realm looking distinct, but also feeling distinct to play in from one another. Every location almost feels like a puzzle box that you’re gradually unlocking through a combination of brain and brawn as you make your way through it. There''s also plenty to discover, with some realms surprising in their vastness. Exploration is encouraged via boat on the Dwarven seas, or via dog sled across Elven deserts. Once again, Metroidvania elements encourage you to revisit blocked paths at a later date once you own the skill required.</p>
  <p>These new worlds bring with them dangerous new threats. If there were any faults to be found in 2018''s revival, then modest enemy variety may well have been one of them. However, there is no such issue in Ragnarok, with its bestiary vastly expanded to accommodate all sizes and shapes of creatures. Familiar foes such as draugr and elves have made their way across, but this time they''re joined by Grims which, you guessed it, are pretty grim scuttling toad people, and a personal favourite, the Einherjar; Aesir warriors who harness the power of the Bifrost that makes a section of your health bar glow before removing that chunk on the next hit. Each forms a part of a whole – there’s an engaging but never unfair difficulty curve throughout as you’re met with progressively greater threats.</p>
  <p>Side missions are sometimes spectacles in their own right. Standout Favours involve helping giant creatures in distress and adventures full of personal revelations through the lush jungles of Vanaheim. They are a great source of character development as you learn more about your friends and companions by helping them right past wrongs. Some side quests do just present a pure gameplay challenge over extra stories, however, such as hunting down powerful legendary enemies dotted across the realms of Yggdrasil’s roots. </p>

  <p>There is no shortage of genuinely tough side boss encounters, either. While I was perhaps taking them on too early out of eagerness, they were a great test of skill nonetheless. Chipping away at larger health bars is a really satisfying challenge and remarkably well-balanced against the standard quick-kill nature of the majority of Ragnarok’s fights. It’s yet another testament to the masterful combat design on display. And yes, there are some absolutely tough-as-nails, endgame-level challenges to rival the Valkyries of 2018, but I''m going to let you find out what those are for yourself.</p>
  <p>There''s a substantial slew of collectibles to clean up as well with Odin''s Ravens, puzzle chests, artifacts, and much more to find in every corner. There''s a ton to be done after the main story has been brought to a close, all of it incredibly moreish and fun to complete. Regardless of their nature, all of the optional content is joyously snackable. They not only flesh out the world of Ragnarok and riff smartly on the mythology, but also serve as valuable father-and-son time, with the end of the world creeping ever closer. </p>
  <p>Ragnarok never once rests on its laurels, throwing new ways to play at you until the very end. Despite having a seemingly endless amount to praise here, I really have barely scratched the surface of what God of War Ragnarok has to offer – I’m deliberately omitting dozens of secrets and surprises. I wouldn''t dare spoil what''s to come for anyone booting it up for the first time, but rest assured, there are both huge story moments and fresh gameplay additions that live up to and often surpass expectations. Taken all together, much like The Godfather Part 2, God of War Ragnarok delivers not only a chapter that reaches the lofty heights of its predecessor but leaves it impossible to imagine the series without it.</p>',

	'<iframe width="700" height="400" src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yt2VPumltwQ?">
</iframe>
<hr width="800"/>
<p>At this point, it’s probably fair to say that Team Ninja has a pretty good handle on this whole soulslike genre thing.<br/> Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty may not reach the same heights as Nioh 2 did back in 2020, but it certainly scratches <br/> that same itch of lightning-fast combat, punishing-yet-rewarding difficulty, and deep build customization options <br/> that you can craft and tailor to your own playstyle.<br/>  It’s great for the same reasons that the Nioh games are, and it accomplishes that feat even while completely changing <br/> up the fundamentals of its combat system to be closer to Sekiro than Dark Souls.<br/>  But by that same token, it also falls victim to the same familiar issues nagging at those other Team Ninja soulslikes,<br/>  including subpar storytelling and excessively fiddly loot mechanics.<br/>  But when you consider that the things Wo Long does better than just about any other game in this genre, that <br/> baggage amounts to scratches on an otherwise pristine set of armor.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history you may get more out of Wo Long’s story than I did  <br/>(my knowledge basically begins and ends with the fact that you should not pursue Lu Bu), but I think even then it won’t <br/>be a highlight because Team Ninja continues to struggle with telling a memorable story with likable characters. This is a <br/>supernatural take on the final days  of the Han Dynasty, where we take control of a nameless warrior who gets swept up <br/>in a power struggle between warring kingdoms and their pursuit of an elixir of immortality. In practically every level you <br/>team up with some sort of historically significant warrior to fight through a level, have a boss battle against an evil or<br/> corrupted historically significant warrior, and then move on to the next one.</p>
<iframe width="700" height="400" src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBUEbBrLmXY?">
</iframe>
<p>Characters are introduced at a rapid-fire pace and leave the scene just as quickly, often without making any sort of impact<br/>on the overall story. Sometimes they return many hours later, but I’d already forgotten them because they didn’t do anything<br/> meaningful. Fortunately, the actual gameplay in between the cutscenes make up the vast majority of what we’re here to do, <br/>and it’s there that Wo Long shines brightest.</p>
<h3>The Dance of Combat</h3>
<p>Wo Long’s combat is a puzzle that needs to be figured out really quickly if you plan on getting past even the first major boss, <br/> but once you solve it, it’s incredibly satisfying to play around in. Similar to Sekiro, it’s a system that relies a lot on carefully <br/>timing deflections so you can preserve your Spirit meter while also avoiding damage, especially when enemies also start<br/> mixing in powerful, unblockable attacks that have to be parried rather than blocked. Crucially, though, you can completely<br/> negate damage from regular attacks just by holding down the block button, so long as you have enough Spirit built up to avoid <br/>having your guard broken – if that happens, you’re left helpless. You can even hold down the block button while also attempting <br/>to deflect, making it so that even if you’re too late on the deflection timing, you’ll still block the attack.</p>
<h1>Once you solve the puzzle of Wo Long''s combat, it''s incredibly satisfying to play around in.</h1>
<hr width="800"/>
<p>It’s a good thing that Wo Long has this leniency built in because in practically every other regard, it doesn’t pull any punches. <br/>Enemies will regularly power through your attacks to deal a more powerful blow of their own, they have combos that go on <br/>for days, and they do a really good job at varying the rhythm of their attacks to try and bait you into parrying too early. It<br/> rewards a careful eye and punishes falling into a predictable rhythm. Even with all of that it isn’t nearly as hard as Nioh 2, <br/>for reasons I’ll get to later, but it still manages to find a really satisfying balance of being tough, fair, and absolutely <br/>exhilarating once you start to pick up on an enemy’s attack patterns and find yourself deflecting each hit of an incoming combo.</p>
<iframe width="700" height="400" src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qspFZLpsADs?">
</iframe>
<p>One clever wrinkle is that your Spirit meter is also a resource that can be spent on spells, special martial arts abilities,<br/> and Spirit attacks. That’s a nice risk-reward mechanic that lets you put yourself in a potentially more vulnerable position <br/>in order to gain some sort of advantage. If you know an enemy has an elemental weakness, for instance, you can exploit<br/> that by spending Spirit to enchant your weapon with an element to stagger and quickly break them. Martial arts abilities <br/>are unique depending on the weapon you’re wielding, and there are many that offer powerful attacks that can either do big <br/>single-target damage or give you a way to deal with many enemies at once. Finally, Spirit attacks are powerful strikes that <br/>increase in damage the more Spirit you have built up, which give you another reason to hold onto your Spirit meter until you <br/>need it.</p>
<h1>I never felt like I was stuck against a wall with no idea of how to overcome a particular challenge.</h1>
<hr width="800"/>
<p>If it’s not already clear, there are tons of layers to Wo Long’s combat, which greatly enhances the already excellent swordplay <br/>by laying out a ton of options and ways to vary up my strategy whenever I found myself dying repeatedly to a particular boss.<br/> If just straight-up attacking didn’t work I could focus more on defense and reduce their Spirit by deflecting their big attacks;<br/> failing that, I could double down on rushing them down and trying to break their Spirit with aggressive attacks and martial arts<br/> abilities. Or, if I could figure out what they were weak to, I could try using spells. So while Wo Long is certainly tough, I never <br/>felt like I was ever stuck against a wall with no idea of what else I could try or how to overcome a particular challenge.</p>
<h3>Top 10 Soulslikes</h3>
<img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/02/11/top10soulslikes-sscover-1613082108012.jpg" alt="Top 10 Soulslikes" width="800" height="500"/>
<h3>The Loot Problem</h3>
<p>Where Wo Long feels very similar to the previous three Team Ninja soulslikes – in a bad way – is in its loot. More specifically,<br/> there’s an overabundance of it. I became absolutely inundated with garbage gear that I had no use for within just a few hours,<br/> and it only got worse after that. I’m just not the kind of person who really wants to spend 10 to 15 minutes in a menu trying to<br/> decipher whether a -2.6% reduction in Martial Arts Spirit is worth sacrificing a +7.2% Genuine Qi Obtention, or if I’m willing <br/>to sacrifice a few points of attack power for +24 alliance Spirit defense. Those simply aren’t interesting decisions – those are <br/>spreadsheet entries and math problems, and it’s made worse by not even being able to sort your massive list of weapons by set, <br/>or by a specific special effect you’re looking for.</p>
<h1>Where Wo Long feels very similar to the previous three Team Ninja soulslikes – in a bad way – is in its loot.</h1>
<hr width="800"/>
<p>I’m fully aware that there are people who love these games for this level of hyper-specific build optimization, and if that is you, <br/>then you’ll find a lot to appreciate here. You can salvage junk gear to extract their special effects, then slot those special effects <br/>into weapons that you want to use, and then you can copy the appearance of any other weapon or armor so you don’t have to <br/>worry about being forced to use an ugly weapon or armor set because it has great stats. It’s fairly exhaustive in its options,<br/> but it’s also not for those of us who prefer action to menu screens.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found that I didn’t have to get too far in the weeds on my first playthrough because I was more than powerful <br/>enough just by engaging with loot on a surface level. For armor, I just picked whatever gave me the highest defense number <br/>without putting me into the heavyweight category, which would limit my mobility. Then I would pick a weapon type I liked, <br/>swap it with one with a higher gear score whenever I came across one; similarly, when I found one that came with a Martial<br/> Arts ability that I liked, I just upgraded that as high as I could. No major tweaking was necessary to keep me from falling <br/>behind the power curve, leaving the complexity for those who are looking to test their mettle in the multiple iterations of New <br/>Game+ or PvP invasions.</p>
<h3>Raising Morale</h3>
<p>One of my favorite new ideas in Wo Long is the addition of Morale Ranks, which is basically a separate progression system<br/> that starts at zero at the beginning of every main mission and goes all the way up to 25. You gain morale simply by defeating<br/> enemies, but you’ll gain it even faster by killing them using Spirit attacks, Martial Arts abilities, or critical strikes. You will <br/>also lose some morale everytime you die, up to a certain point determined by your fortitude level, which you can increase by <br/>finding various flag poles throughout each mission. Enemies have Morale Ranks too, and those with a higher rank than you deal<br/> more damage. I love this addition because it gives every level a very natural ramp-up in difficulty, while adding extra incentive<br/> to explore and mop up more bad guys.</p>',

<hr width="800"/>
<p>When it comes to next-gen racing games, I’ll admit I generally reach for the wheel of Forza Horizon 5’s approachable <br/>open world over the close second that is Gran Turismo 7’s more rigid dedication to realism. But the shiny new PlayStation <br/>VR2 headset is like a burst of nitrous oxide in the latter’s engine, narrowly pushing GT7 ahead of the competition by finally <br/>putting its money where its mouth has always been. Impressive headset haptics, HDR, and 3D audio all come together so<br/> believably, creating a one-of-a-kind experience that any car junkie or racing fan should want to dive into, even if you aren’t <br/>usually into the strict regimentation and slow-burn progression GT7 lays down. And if you are already a bonafide Gran Turismo<br/>fan, the PS VR2 offers such a visual and experiential feast that it’s hard not to call GT7’s VR mode an essential upgrade.</p>
<p>Gran Turismo 7 VR’s lifelike cabin visuals and physics often feel like I’m taking an actual sports car for a joyride down the Deep<br/> Forest Raceway or through Tokyo’s Central Circuit, generally at speeds that would land me in deep trouble in real life. Trust me<br/> when I say once you’ve raced a Ferrari Vision GT at 300 mph in the rain – with dirt and water splashing all across your virtual <br/>windshield, only a few inches in front of your face – you’ll probably be as motivated as I was to see everything Gran Turismo’s <br/>campaign can throw at you.</p>
<p>While menus are still disappointingly composited onto a flat screen inside of your headset, your entire 110-degree field of view <br/>lights up with detail and color once you enter a race or one of several VR-specific modes. Turning your head left and right gives <br/>you an actual sense of your surroundings, and unsurprisingly, playing GT7 competently in VR mode demands you have a similar <br/>level of spatial awareness as if you were driving a real car. Rearview mirrors and other reference points provide a strong sense of <br/>how your vehicle handles, and I imagine it’s even more grounding if you have a fancy steering wheel setup.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the PS5’s packed-in DualSense controller works great on its own. It provides a nice mixture of haptic bumps and jerks<br/> to replicate the motion of a steering wheel in my hands and uses its adaptive triggers to mirror pedal resistance on my index fingers<br/> as engines roar in all directions. If you collide with a wall or another vehicle, the PS VR2’s in-headset haptic vibrators give a <br/>satisfying jolt of feedback. All of these details quickly add up in my mind, making me feel like I am truly in the cockpit in a way that’s <br/>actually quite rare for a VR game. It’s a way better example of what virtual reality does well than many other games which – for instance <br/>– can ask you to simulate walking around by swinging your arms left and right</p>
<h1>"Playing in VR made me care more deeply about GT7''s rules."</h1>
<hr width="800"/>
<p>It does suck that you don’t ever get to watch yourself physically step into the cabin, and it’s similarly disappointing there are no special<br/> animations or VR scenes to portray what’s going on between menu selections. None of your vehicle’s consoles or buttons are interactive<br/> other than lighting up when your headlights are turned on either, which happens automatically in darker driving conditions. But it’s not <br/>like Gran Turismo 7 was ever particularly focused on flair or excess to begin with, and even the simple menus are forgivable when they are<br/> still a pretty convenient way of getting around. While inside a vehicle’s cabin, I’m never really focused on anything other than the road<br/> itself anyway, so the lack of virtual interactivity is a minor downside considering the otherwise transcendental racing experience.</p>
<p>Bringing Gran Turismo 7 into virtual reality did something I didn’t expect: it made me care more deeply about its rules. When I was so physically entrenched in its virtual simulation, I spent the time to really learn how to navigate its optional systems. The intuitive in-race HUD is seamlessly mapped over my vehicle’s physical dashboard, but fine-tuning my ride doesn’t just change a number on a screen anymore; it affects the way the car handles, and in VR, I can feel those subtle changes in my body. That includes TCL, fuel mapping, brake positioning, tuning, and more adjustments. That nuance can be a lot tougher to pick out when you’re playing in third-person mode with less audiovisual and haptic feedback guiding you, but in VR I could truly learn the ins and outs of my vehicles. That makes the simulation aspects of GT7 that might be intimidating to some that much more important – and captivating – in VR.</p>
<p>When the PS5’s many cylinders are all firing during peak moments, GT7 VR positively radiates eye candy, pushing vast draw distances and rendering a ton of action at once. This is best exemplified when you’re a tailing a car neck-and-neck – and then out of the corner of your eye, you catch several other cars chasing you in your rearview mirror to the backdrop of a sunrise glinting over the French countryside. There is nothing quite like this anywhere else, and it really is a testament to how good the PS VR2’s technical specs are. The immersion is only broken by a few animation glitches here and there, like your avatar''s hand occasionally glitching through the gear shifter, but you really have to be looking for them. Some minor missing details like the lack of a handbrake animation may also annoy detail sticklers, but they don’t ruin the experience when so much care has clearly been put into everything else.</p>
<p>Shopping for vehicles in GT7 has a shiny new layer to it since you can now activate the drop-dead gorgeous VR Showroom. This lets you spend as much time as you’d like with a full-scale replica of every single car in Gran Turismo 7’s expansive fleet. It’s neat to hear the growl of a new Jaguar F-Type R V-8 engine up close, both inside and outside of the vehicle. Popping into your garage lets you enter a more expansive version of the same VR Showroom mode, allowing you to travel to a wider variety of locations. Here, you can play with the lighting options to get all kinds of up-close angles of each of your owned vehicles, which is a delightful way to drink in Gran Turismo 7’s photorealistic lighting system in the PS VR2’s full 4K HDR OLED glory. It’s impossible to describe how cool it is to physically stand next to one of my own custom liveries, especially when they may have started as a silly in-joke between friends.</p>

<p>VR replays provide a novel approach to reliving your best racing moments, though I can’t say they’re the most comfortable. You basically stand-in as the replay camera while GT7 itself moves you ahead of the swiftest car on the track every few seconds. This is kinda jarring, but it gives you opportunities to watch (and record) the track from unique angles as the racers zoom past. It also lets you hear cars screech by as their engines and tires echo around the geometry of the track, and GT7’s use of the Doppler shows off just how good its 3D sound design and audio spatialization are.</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>Gran Turismo 7 is the same amazing simulation-focused racer it always has been, but playing in a PlayStation VR2 headset has elevated it in ways I wasn’t expecting. Driving its intense and alluring races in VR adds such a high level of tactility that you can physically feel the tweaks you make to your car, demystifying a lot of the otherwise intimidating optional customization for the average player. It also looks stunning, making up for flat menus and the lack of interactivity in its cabins with impressive lighting and audio alike. If you’re buying a PlayStation VR2 headset anyway, and you had to buy just one game to keep you busy for an indefinite amount of time, make it this one.</p>',

<p></p>
<p>The patch, which includes several bug fixes alongside a handful of quality of life improvements, has been long anticipated by fans after Pokémon Scarlet and Violet launched in a state <a href="/articles/pokemon-scarlet-violet-patch-nintendo-tech-problems">Nintendo itself was forced to apologise for</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the new quality of life changes, as outlined on <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Pokemon-Scarlet-and-Pokemon-Violet-2299678.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo''s website</a>, revolve around Pokémon Boxes, with Nintendo aiming to make it a little bit easier to manage the status of Pokémon all in one place.</p>
<p>From the Pokémon summary screen, players will now be able to change the nickname, markings, held item, and mark or Ribbon-related titles, reorder moves, have the Pokémon remember or forget moves, and use TMs.</p>
<p>The patch also makes it easier to swap out held items and move Pokémon around in large quantities, and it will now be easier to tell which Pokémon are in Battle Teams.</p>
<p>As for bug fixes, which are perhaps of a bigger concern to <a href="/articles/pokmon-scarlet-and-violet-sell-18-million-units">the near 20 million people who''ve bought Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>, Nintendo is addressing several issues across different categories including Tera Raids and Battles.</p>
<p>A Tera Pokémon''s health not being accurately reflected in the HP bar, connectivity issues, National Dex Pokémon showing up in the Paldea Pokédex, random items appearing unintentionally in the world, and more (viewable in the full notes below) will all be addressed.</p>
<p>Nintendo also confirmed it would continue to update Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and address further issues in the future, but gave no information regarding when the next update would arrive.</p>
<p>This February update will be just the second released for the games despite several issues being reported following their launch. <a href="/articles/pokmon-scarlet-and-violet-players-are-majorly-struggling-with-online-tera-raids">These included a broken PvE experience in the endgame</a>, a <a href="/articles/pokemon-scarlet-violet-battle-stadium-bug">rigged Battle Stadium</a>, <a href="/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-duplication-glitch-clone-shiny-pokemon">duplication glitches</a>, a <a href="/articles/weird-pokmon-scarlet-and-violet-hack-lets-you-run-twice-as-fast">bizarre method of running at double speed</a>, and more.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review">The poor performance was also a major factor in our 6/10 review</a>, as IGN said: "The open-world gameplay of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is a brilliant direction for the future of the franchise, but this promising shift is sabotaged by the numerous ways in which Scarlet and Violet feel deeply unfinished."</p>', 'NEWS', 'The games launched with several performance issues.', '2023-03-16 15:33:33.721000 +00:00', '2023-03-20 15:33:35.694000 +00:00'),

<p>"Right now a major, major new Hitman game... that''s a little bit on hiatus, as we''re building another agent fantasy that''s also taking up a lot of our time," Elverdam said. "But obviously we''ll come back to beloved Agent 47. He''s still very much in the heart of this company."</p>
<p>The "agent fantasy" Elverdam is talking about is, of course, <a href="/articles/hitman-developer-announces-new-bond-game-project-007">the James Bond game that was announced in 2020</a>, that currently has just a codename of Project 007.

<p><a href="/articles/hitman-3-being-rebranded-as-world-of-assassination-putting-entire-trilogy-in-one-package">IO Interactive recently rebranded Hitman 3 as World of Assassination</a>, folding in all previous Hitman Trilogy levels into the game and also launching the Freelance roguelike mode.

<p>"I hope we can have our cake and eat it too, in the sense that we have such a wonderful platform where we can keep experimenting with what the formula can do and what people expect of it," Elverdam said.</p>
<p>"And then at some point, obviously, as any creative, it would be nice to then go in and say, ''Okay, well, with everything we''ve learned, what would that be if we had to re-articulate a sandbox. What would that look like?"</p>
<p>IO Interactive will certainly have plenty to keep it busy outside of Hitman though, as it announced in February that <a href="/articles/hitman-developer-io-interactive-working-on-an-online-fantasy-rpg">an online fantasy RPG is also in development at the studio</a>.

<hr width="800"/>
<p>It is still unbelievable to me that after 26 years of linear, straightforward RPGs, developer Game Freak really looked Pokémon players dead in the eye and said, “It’s fine, go wherever you want.” In the lead-up to the launch of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, I thought this claim would end up being a marketing gimmick, a little joke, something we’d all be mad about later. But from the moment I left the hallowed halls of Uva Academy, that promise has been wonderfully fulfilled, with open-world, open-ended gameplay serving as a shining beacon for the future of this beloved franchise. And yet, a finger on the cursed <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Mankey">Mankey</a>’s paw has curled anyway – Scarlet and Violet’s wonderfully innovative design is dramatically undermined by the numerous ways in which they feel deeply unfinished, with issues ranging from an incomplete world to massive and ubiquitous technical problems. So even though I want to celebrate how this generation reinvents and reinvigorates the world of Pokémon, I can’t without putting a great big warning label on it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The actual act of playing Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is some of the most fun Pokémon has ever been, thanks to Game Freak’s commitment to a truly open world. From the second you leave the school after the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Prologue_-_First_Day_of_School">tutorial</a>, you can run all the way to late-game areas full of powerful trainers and <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Gym_Leaders">Gym Leaders</a>, catch high-level Pokémon, and make the adventure very difficult and rewarding for yourself accordingly. For anyone worried about accidentally leaping into a too-difficult area, fear not: Paldea is largely arranged to be friendly to those looking for a more gradual challenge, and even moreso is designed just right for getting pleasantly lost, backtracking, and wandering off the beaten route. </p>
<p>Given that there’s no level scaling at play (as is Pokémon tradition), exploring Paldea at a steady but unguided pace will somewhat inevitably have you encountering foes that are either extra challenging or too easy at different points. Running up against a trainer who’s just a few levels higher than you can be a blast, especially when an unexpected Pokémon on your team comes in clutch to get the win and earn a giant pile of EXP. I had multiple tense moments against <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Starfall_Street">Team Star</a> especially, like when their giant car Pokémon nearly decimated my slightly underleveled team as I pushed down a more challenging road.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But even when I briefly ran roughshod over several areas in a row because I’d outleveled them, I didn’t find it dull. With roughly <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Pokedex_-_All_Pokemon_in_Scarlet_and_Violet">400 different Pokémon</a> species available, I was still enjoying poking around the lower-level areas and finding monsters I hadn’t seen yet, and those discoveries were rewarding even when the battles weren’t. It’s a process made especially delightful by how silly and clever many of the new Pokémon designs are this generation, like the apparently edible <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Lechonk">Lechonk</a>, or the absurd not-actually-Diglett eel <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Wiglett">Wiglett</a>. The monster behavior is much improved too, as I loved stumbling upon flocks of Starly, Magikarp flopping on the shoreline, Hoppip floating nervously out of the rain, or herds of Deerling protected by a kingly Sawsbuck. With so many monsters to see, it was wonderfully easy to get lost and distracted in the enormous “areas” – Scarlet and Violet’s replacement for routes.</p>
<p>Moving across the grassy plains and rocky deserts of the land of Paldea is made easier thanks to a <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Legendaries">legendary Pokémon</a> you obtain right at the start that’s determined by whether you are playing Scarlet or Violet. Either way, this Pokémon can be used as a bike and is upgraded with new movement options through one of the <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Walkthrough_-_Main_Quests_by_Level">three main storylines</a>. The dash, climb, and swimming upgrades are all helpful for crossing big Paldean expanses quickly, but one of those upgrades is a glide ability that can’t hold a candle to the one we got earlier this year in Legends: Arceus. It’s better than nothing, but I’m disappointed by the way you almost immediately lose altitude when gliding, dashing my dream of jumping from atop the highest mountain and soaring across the whole map.</p>
<p>Biking across all that land, especially as I closed in on the endgame, also made Paldea feel strikingly empty. Scarlet and Violet are at least an improvement over Legends: Arceus in this regard, mostly thanks to their robust Pokémon variety, tons of hidden items, and the general design and placement of rare Pokémon and secrets. But there still isn’t the same level of detail we’ve seen in other open-world Switch games like <a href="/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> or <a href="/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, and no sign of anything resembling the dungeons, puzzles, or other more contained challenges that were staples of older Pokémon games, either. </p>
<p>The realization that almost the entirety of Scarlet and Violet <em>are </em>their interconnected outdoor zone is even more pronounced when you look closely at the detail that <em>is</em> there. Towns are all unique, colorful, and full of personality. Each one has distinct buildings and landmarks, like <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Artazon">Artazon’s</a> windmill or Porto Marinada’s fishing docks, and there’s clearly been a lot of thought put into modeling them after diverse and specific locations in and around real-world Spain. But for the most part, that’s where the thoughtfulness ends. Most buildings are facades you can’t enter, with nothing to do around them. Most stores are just menus you open when you interact with the door, and the biggest cities have the same storefronts repeated over and over. To give an example, in one city I was excited to run into what was clearly a warehouse for in-game store chain Delibird Presents – it looked like a warehouse, had the logo, and everything. I expected I’d be able to go inside, and that there might be workers, a sidequest, vendors, or something unique in there. But it was just an unopenable box. Someone put enough thought into the world to imagine this company would have a headquarters in the town I was in, but the idea went no further.</p>
<p>That blankness unfortunately extends to many of the NPCs scattered around the world, too. Older Pokémon games are dotted with characters who would engage in short conversations with you about gameplay tips, Pokémon, world lore, or just goofy one-liners that gave them personality. I wouldn’t say that element is absent from Scarlet and Violet, but it’s certainly lessened, almost like someone ran out of time to write interesting dialogue for all these people walking laps around their towns. A lot of the trainer and bystander NPC dialogue is roughly on the level of “I like Pokémon!”, while the more in-depth explanations of the world are relegated to classes you can take at the school. Don’t get me wrong: I love the classes and the ways in which they manage to build Scarlet and Violet’s lore while also tutorializing things about Pokémon even I didn’t know after decades engrossed in the series. But it’s strange that the NPC department has suffered so much when the writing in the central storylines is otherwise stellar, especially given that the main cast of characters are some of the most interesting Pokémon’s had in a while.</p>
<p>While previous games have essentially followed one plotline with a few momentary distractions, Scarlet and Violet’s three main stories – one about the usual <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Victory_Road">Pokémon Gym challenge</a>, one about a bunch of student delinquents, and one about five powerful <a href="/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Path_of_Legends">“Titan” Pokémon</a> – are an idea Game Freak has successfully made the most of. By giving each story its own separate threads and main characters rather than blending them all together, some truly excellent personalities are able to shine. I don’t think I’ve ever loved a Gym Leader as much as I’ve loved the everyman Normal-type leader Larry, and the Path of the Titans plot had me a little choked up when I learned about my classmate Arven’s true goals. Sure, it’s still a kids game – don’t expect Nier: Automata levels of depth here – but there’s a lot of humor, cleverness, and heart contained in Scarlet and Violet’s writing, and it all culminates in a bombastic ending that goes surprisingly hard for a Pokémon game. All told, it took me about 35 hours to reach the credits, and I’ve played through the hearty endgame PvE content for an additional 15 since then, without having quite finished every sidequest and found every secret. </p>
<p>Alongside their open world, Scarlet and Violet come with a number of new and returning features to supplement their exploration. Character customization is back, and while the initial character facial design is much more detailed than in the past (except for skin tone, we’re <em>still </em>limited to only four options for some reason), the clothing customization is just sad. Both Sword/Shield and Arceus have tons of cute outfits to select from, but in Scarlet and Violet you’re stuck with four ugly school uniforms, and that’s all you get… forever. You can customize hats, backpacks, shoes, socks, gloves, and glasses, but when the main outfit you’re going to wear for the next 50 hours is aggressively purple, those little accessories don’t feel much like real options. What am I going to do with a green hat, for instance? I’d look like a grape!</p>
<p>Another supporting feature that’s returning with significant modifications is the ability for Pokémon to follow you out in the world. This time, you can also send them out in “Let’s Go!” mode to automatically battle wild Pokémon they encounter, earning you EXP and items accordingly. It’s a touch clunky in terms of whether or not your Pokémon will actually target the thing you’re asking them to, especially when you’re supposed to use it during specific story segments to battle a horde of trainers all at once. But it’s a pleasant and fast way to gather items to craft TMs that teach Pokémon new moves, and works well enough for the kind of item economy Game Freak has built with Scarlet and Violet. I’m not sure it’s game changing, though, especially since my Pokémon never run as fast as I do, and if I want them to follow me I inevitably have to keep sending them out over and over as I repeatedly outpace them.</p>
<p>While the battle system remains largely unchanged from past Pokémon games (and certainly doesn’t embrace any of the more interesting shifts I loved in Legends: Arceus), the one major new addition is the expected generational battle gimmick of choice: Terastallizing. That’s a fancy term for a mechanic that temporarily gives one Pokémon in your party a superpowered monotype and a cool new bejeweled hat, but what’s most interesting about it is that any Pokémon can have any Tera typing, including types they wouldn’t normally have. This results in fun and unusual combinations, like a dragon-type Cloyster or an electric-type Gyarados. While some of these unusual Tera types can be found through exploring Paldea, the best and most interesting combinations are gained through Tera raid battles, which are Scarlet and Violet’s endgame answer to Sword and Shield’s excellent Dynamax raids.</p>
<p>As with Dynamax raids, up to four players can participate in these time-limited battles to take down and capture superpowered Tera Pokémon with strange Tera types. Tera raid battles also feature a major improvement over Sword and Shield’s raid battles, in that you no longer have to sit through all of your opponents’ attacks each turn – everyone just moves simultaneously. It’s a huge time saver. I’ve had a great time hunting down interesting Tera Pokémon, and am extremely optimistic about its potential to keep the Scarlet and Violet community alive and well for the next year or more – if the technical problems don’t kill it first.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the Donphan in the room here: these games run like garbage. The framerate is an inconsistent mess, lighting effects toggle on and off seemingly at random, models pop in and out at short distances and sometimes very rapidly like weirdo ghosts, characters who aren’t even that far away walk like a bad stop-motion animated cartoon, everything slows to a crawl when there’s more than one environmental effect (like rain or ocean waves) on screen at a time, and battles themselves can take an agonizingly long time as new Pokémon are swapped in. There are also tons of bizarre clipping issues where Pokémon can get caught in walls or underground, or the camera gets stuck at an odd angle and show an empty void on half the screen. Wild Pokémon will sometimes appear directly underneath you unexpectedly, trigger battles when you’re not touching them, or vanish inexplicably – a problem that’s especially annoying if the Pokémon in question is rare or, worse, shiny. For a more in-depth rundown of the technical mess, we’ve done a Performance Review on the specific issues that sheds some light on what’s going on here:</p>
<p>This is all bad enough, but it’s all exacerbated by the fact that Scarlet and Violet would be far from pretty games even if they ran well. While the aesthetic and architectural aspects of many of the towns in Paldea are interesting, they’re surrounded by incredibly low-resolution textures, long stretches of ugly, unremarkable terrain, and a weird, vague, shimmery effect around most objects. This is made especially odd by the fact that some of the character models and most of the Pokémon do actually look very good, but then you stand next to one of the pixelated Team Star flags and wonder what happened to cause such a dramatic disparity between that and your character’s uniform.</p>
<p>The issues do not end there – Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are also stuffed with bizarre bugs. They mostly manifest as small, funny, or harmless problems, such as being able to move at twice the speed with a second controller plugged in for some reason, but also there are more severe problems. For example, for some reason two of our guides writers suffered hard crashes when they walked near a ladder. At one point, two items were sitting on the ground that I was unable to pick up or interact with at all until I progressed the story further – and then they mysteriously began working again.</p>
<p>If you checked IGN ahead of launch you may have seen my <a href="/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-in-progress">review in progress</a>, in which I held off on a score largely because I hadn’t been able to try Scarlet and Violet’s online features – and it’s a good thing I did, because online adds an entirely new layer of weirdness. In addition to all the aforementioned technical issues, while online I experienced brand-new problems – at one point my friends turned invisible while riding their bikes, and at another the bikes turned invisible so my friends were floating in odd squats midair. I saw everyone’s faces get stuck in different emotes after using the camera app, resulting in permanent shocked or depressed expressions. One of my friends appeared in the doorway of every building I entered in a weird YMCA pose despite being nowhere near the area I was in. There were multiple communication errors that forced us to disband and reform groups just to keep playing, which is itself a time-consuming process. Oh, and there was an utterly bizarre moment where my friend briefly turned into a giant noodle man. Local co-op seems to have slightly fewer weird bugs than online (my colleague kept weirdly teleporting across the map on my screen for no reason), but broadly still runs as abysmally as the rest.</p>
<p>This is a massive shame because, like the rest of Scarlet and Violet, the actual gameplay ideas in its co-op system are promising, if unrefined. Between debilitating bugs, my friends and I were able to do almost everything you can do alone in Scarlet and Violet side-by-side, if not explicitly cooperatively. They were able to complete early game story events that I had already finished while I hopped to the next town over to do some endgame content they didn’t have access to yet. I could take photos with them, set up picnics and build absurd sandwiches together, and watch them battle wild Pokémon. They can battle trainer NPCs in the field, too, but this is an odder situation because you can’t actually see the Pokémon fighting, so the two character models just sort of stand there and glare at one another while the friends of the battling player can run through the middle of the battlefield and make weird faces mid-fight. The bones of an excellent co-op system are mostly there – they just feel like they are held together with bits of wire and string.</p>
<p>By far the best part of cooperative play, both technically and design-wise, is the aforementioned Tera raid battles. Though still plagued with some lag and occasional online connection weirdness, the four-person battles against powerful, jewel-like Pokémon mostly ran smoothly while in co-op, and they provide a fun treasure hunt of their own to embark on while playing with friends. Jumping into battles randomly online without turning on co-op mode could have been a great way to hunt Scarlet and Violet’s strongest monsters, but that has its own drawbacks. Even with an ethernet connection, matchmaking was a painful process with repeated connection errors and awkward queues that left me sitting around for an hour trying to find a raid I could join – not to mention intermittent lag and more of the same visual bugs that cause Pokémon to appear and disappear mid-battle. </p>
<p>Having talked with several others about their own experiences with the technical mayhem in Scarlet and Violet, it does seem like your mileage may vary. Some people are reporting nothing more than some minor framerate blips. Other people I know have had multiple hard crashes, and have lost save data as a result due to turning off autosave (though alongside all the other weird bugs in this game, <a href="https://twitter.com/GameXplain/status/1594034207877402624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>there’s apparently a workaround to retrieve that data</u></a>). My personal experience has fallen somewhere in the middle of those, but the middle is still extremely rough, and fundamentally none of this should be the case for anyone. It’s shocking that a behemoth like Pokémon would be released in such a messy state, with no communication yet on whether or not we can expect a fix any time soon. (Nintendo has historically not been very aggressive about patching its games, which leaves us to worry that fixes might never come.) While I truly believe that patches could bring Scarlet and Violet into a more playable place, the fact remains that this is a product Game Freak, Creatures, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo deemed acceptable to release. Pokémon and its fans deserve far better than this.</p>

<p>Gungrave G.O.R.E has exactly one mission objective, three words that flash across the screen at the beginning of each level and every time you die: Kick their ass. For the 12-15 hour campaign, you’ll do exactly that – shoot, slash, blow up, and otherwise execute thousands of enemies and bosses on your quest to eradicate the Raven Clan and save the world from an evil drug called SEED. When it works, which is often, Gungrave G.O.R.E is a captivating ballet of blood and bullets that merges Gungrave’s signature style with the best aspects of modern action games. Unfortunately, for everything Gungrave G.O.R.E does right, there are an equal number of frustrations and missed opportunities, making it difficult to recommend to anyone outside of action game aficionados or hardcore Gungrave fans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gungrave G.O.R.E picks up where Gungrave VR and Gungrave VR U.N left off. You don’t have to have played any previous Gungrave games or seen the anime adaptation to pick up what G.O.R.E is laying down, though it will definitely help – if you’re new to the series, there’s a short video explaining its history to help you along. The setup is a bit goofy: SEED, a drug with a knack for transforming its users into monsters that was thought to be eradicated, has actually survived. This time, it’s being sold by the Raven Clan, so Mika, Beyond the Grave (Grave to his friends, and your main protagonist), Dr. Aso, newcomer Quartz, and the rest of the rather forgettable El-Al Canhel head to Scumland to stop SEED production and take the Raven Clan, and its four bosses, down. </p>
<p>Things escalate from there, of course, but Gungrave G.O.R.E’s plot and characters are never strong enough to provoke more than passing interest in what’s going on. Grave is silent as his namesake (he has less than five lines in the entire game, none more than four words long), and the other characters are mostly there to deliver exposition. It doesn’t help that the voice acting is also all over the place and the translation is pretty hit or miss – there are noticeable grammar errors in the written text and weird turns of phrase that don’t sound natural in English. Almost all of G.O.R.E’s story is delivered in cutscenes. In missions, you’ll mostly just have Quartz guiding you from point A to point B with a lot of recycled and unhelpful dialogue like “Grave. They are coming from all sides!” or “There’s the exit,” which gets old pretty fast. G.O.R.E’s story is only there to give you a reason to travel the world, meet new people, and kill them. </p>
<p>The action is really what you’re here for, and Gungrave G.O.R.E does more or less deliver on that. Grave has several abilities at his disposal: a pair of pistols, a charged shot, a big coffin to swing around for various three-hit combos, Demolition Shots (special abilities that cost charges you build up by dealing damage), the ability to reflect certain projectiles, a dodge, and a jump. Pretty standard stuff, but what makes Grave interesting to play are his special abilities. You can grab enemies with Death Hauler, Grave’s coffin, and use them as a human shield, or enter Burst Mode by shooting repeatedly while standing still, which allows Grave to deal massive amounts of damage very quickly. Grave can’t move in Burst Mode, but you can rotate the camera to take out enemies around you. Grave can also execute enemies at low health, which will recover his shield much faster than if you recharge it over time.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not just about killing enemies; you have to look stylish doing it, too. The goal is to drive up Grave’s Beat Count as high as you can by constantly hitting enemies and grabbing a high Art score, which comes from executions, melee combo finishers, and Demolition Shots. Maintaining a high Beat Count is tricky; it disappears very quickly if you’re not hitting or shooting something, which pushes you to constantly be on the attack. It’s a fun challenge to drive it up during encounters and then maintain it between them by shooting objects in the environment, like cars, boxes, or neon signs. Play your cards right, and it’s possible (if difficult) to drive up your Beat Count into the thousands. Getting your Beat Count over 50 even gives you access to Storm Barrage, a rapid-fire attack that hits enemies in all directions and will quickly drive your Beat Count higher when used against large groups.    </p>
<p>The trick is managing all of it. Demolition Shots, for instance, restore health but don’t contribute to your Beat Count, no matter how many enemies you hit with one, though they do give you Art score. Executions provide a shield recharge and up your Art score, but only add one to the Beat Count. Managing all of these things well, along with Grave’s health and shield, can feel great when it all comes together. The shooting is loud and impactful, Demolition Shots are amazing, and executions are appropriately stylish and gory. Melee attacks never quite feel as weighty or damaging as they should, but when you’re pulling off high Beat Counts and landing Demolition Shots, Gungrave G.O.R.E feels fantastic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, everything else is more mixed. Levels are gorgeous, and Gungrave G.O.R.E takes you through a ton of different environments throughout its campaign, from the dirty alleys of Scumland to neon-soaked streets of Hong Kong and the forests of Vietnam, among others. Each place looks, feels, and plays a little differently, and Studio Iggymob has done a great job of imbuing each location with a distinct vibe. The issue is that levels themselves are entirely linear affairs; there are side rooms and small detours, but there’s no reason to ever explore them unless there are enemies there. There are no collectibles to find, no optional objectives to complete, nothing. All you need is kill, which is good because that’s all you''re going to do. </p>
<p>The other problem is the enemies themselves. You’ll have seen most of the enemies Gungrave G.O.R.E has to offer by the time you hit the 10th level (of 31 total), and many of the ones you’ll see after that are just variations. Instead of “guy with rocket launcher,” you might see “guy with rocket launcher that shoots four rockets,” or “guy with rocket launcher that shoots really fast and does lots of damage.” Instead of your standard, SEED-infused Orgman bruiser, you might see one with claws that moves faster and hits harder. These variations aren’t a problem on their own, but when levels reuse the same few enemies over and over again, it can get old. This is especially noticeable in the last few levels, which feature a grand total of four enemy types.</p>
<p>Gungrave G.O.R.E also likes to throw enemies at you that have to be dealt with in specific ways, greatly limiting your combat options. If an enemy is equipped with a shield, for example, you cannot under any circumstances break that shield by shooting at it normally. You have to hit it with melee attacks, a charged shot, deflect a rocket into it, use an environmental explosion, or use specific Demolition Shots. That might not sound bad, but melee attacks are slow and will often miss enemies they should hit, a charged shot requires that you stop shooting long enough to charge it, which means potentially losing your Beat Count, and Demolition Shots are a resource. Even then, Demolition Shots and charged shots will often only destroy a single shield, even if you hit multiple shielded enemies with those attacks. And you have to deal with them immediately; Grave may be powerful, but he’s also slow, and shielded enemies will run right up in your face to stop you from targeting their friends, knock you down, and hit you out of – or sometimes through – your attacks. Worse still, all of that just gets rid of the shield itself. You still have to kill the guy holding it after the fact.</p>
<p>Enemies with powerful guns or rocket launchers are the same way. If you don’t deal with them immediately, you’re probably going to die because G.O.R.E loves to have several of them attack you at a time, their attacks are very difficult to dodge (you can’t really dodge a guy with a machine gun, and rockets basically have to be deflected because they track you) and they hit really hard. All of this makes combat less about using all of Grave’s options and more about using whatever the “right option” to deal with that specific type of enemy is. Gungrave G.O.R.E is better when it’s letting you come up with creative solutions to encounters, but enemies like this shut that down completely.</p>
<p>Boss encounters are much better. G.O.R.E offers a huge variety of bosses to fight, some of which have several phases. Barring a couple of exceptions later on, each is extremely unique and almost all of them are quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, levels don’t start regularly having boss fights until you’re more than halfway through the campaign. Most of the time, a stage will end with a big fight against a ton of smaller enemies, or just stop once you reach a certain point. The former is fine, but the latter is incredibly jarring and can really take you out of the experience.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that all of the levels themselves were great, but they’re also extremely hit-and-miss. In general, Gungrave G.O.R.E tends to get better as it goes on, but even that feels like an incomplete description. Early levels, however, are definitely less fun; most of them lack boss fights, and G.O.R.E has a bad habit of throwing gimmicks at you. One level, for instance, requires Grave to navigate the top of a moving train, avoiding passing signs and oncoming tunnels. This is fine in theory, but Grave is a slow character, and he’s strongest when he isn’t moving. Taking out the enemies around you efficiently, especially early on, when you have a limited moveset, means standing still to use Burst Mode, which opens you up to running into a passing sign or not getting inside the train before you hit a tunnel. Hitting a sign is bad (it will cost you all of your shield and about half of your health) but being atop the train when it goes into a tunnel means instant death and having to redo the entire segment. Avoiding the signs and trying to move quickly opens you up to enemies with rocket launchers and shields, both of which do high damage and can knock you off the train, which, you guessed it, results in instant death and having to do the entire section again.</p>
<p>Difficulty spikes like these make the early game incredibly frustrating. Generally, you’re not dying because you made a mistake, but because you don’t yet have the tools or abilities to deal damage quickly enough. By far the worst example I ran into was the sixth level, where Grave has to hold off a large group of what are, at the time, a lot of really tough Raven Clan enemies. I spent over an hour attempting this segment, but no matter what I did, I couldn’t deal enough damage fast enough. There were simply too many enemies in too small an area, all of whom demanded I deal with them in a specific way, which usually left me vulnerable to something else. I eventually had to turn the difficulty on that encounter down a notch, and that suddenly let me clear it on the first try. Gungrave G.O.R.E actually encourages you to switch difficulties if things get too tough, but it feels bad when the reason you have to do so is that your damage output isn’t up to some arbitrary standard because it didn’t give you enough points to buy the upgrades you need yet. When I came back to that same level later with more abilities, I was able to beat it on the normal difficulty pretty easily. </p>
<p>Speaking of upgrades, you can buy them at the end of each level or from the main menu. You gain points by completing levels, and G.O.R.E scores you in five categories: time, kill rate, life remaining, highest Beat Count, and Art Score on a scale from D to S. It then averages the results for a final score, and points are awarded based on how well you do. Initially, it’s hard to score well – you simply don’t have the abilities you need to maintain high Beat Counts (for reference: a Beat Count in the 300s on most levels will earn you a C) or Art scores, but it becomes easier as you unlock abilities.</p>
<p>Once you have points to spend, you can head to The Lab. There’s a lot to buy: health, shield, and damage upgrades, new melee combos and skills, and new Demolition Shots. As you purchase new stuff, G.O.R.E opens up considerably, and combat becomes much easier and more enjoyable. You can also refund your abilities at any time for their full purchase price, which can be very helpful if you’re stuck. A one-on-one boss fight, for instance, is a lot easier if you max Grave’s targeting range and bullet damage instead of his Storm Barrage, which you’ll mostly use for crowd control and building high Beat Counts against large groups.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the upgrades can’t hide how limited Grave’s moveset is. He never acquires new weapons – the twin pistols and coffin are it – so his playstyle never really changes. New moves can only iterate on what you already have. G.O.R.E does offer two other playable characters, Bunji and Quartz, but they’re only there for one level each and, in Bunji’s case, a small portion of a later level. Their playstyles are a welcome change-up: Bunji is like a faster Grave who can dodge while in Burst mode, and I enjoyed playing him more than I did Grave. Quartz, on the other hand, is more mixed. She’s a melee character in a game not really built for melee characters, and while her moveset is a nice change of pace, it’s not much more than a novelty. You only get each character for a short time, and you can’t upgrade their abilities or buy them new ones. What they come with is what they get. It feels like a huge missed opportunity, especially since Grave never gets anything to really change up his playstyle – you can’t even rebind your controls if you don’t like how things are set.</p>

'Elden Ring Review', 
' <img src="https://eldenring.bn-ent.net/images/common/img_concept_01.jpg">
  <p>In the 87 hours that it took me to beat Elden Ring, I was put through an absolute wringer of emotion: Anger as I was beaten down by its toughest challenges, exhilaration when I finally overcame them, and a fair amount of sorrow for the mountains of exp I lost along the way to some of the toughest boss encounters FromSoftware has ever conceived. But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe – from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Elden Ring nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater. FromSoftware takes the ball that <a href="/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> got rolling and runs with it, creating a fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration above all else, while also somehow managing to seamlessly weave a full-on Dark Souls game into the middle of it. It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that Elden Ring ended up as one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I’ve ever had. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To set the stage, all you know from the outset is that you play as a “Tarnished” of no renown, blessed by grace, and are compelled to make the journey to The Lands Between and become an Elden Lord. What that actually means, how one might go about doing that, and what the deal is with that giant glowing golden tree are all things that you have to discover yourself. Like other FromSoft games, the grand story is hard to fully digest on a first playthrough, especially because there’s no in-game journal to refresh you on the events, characters, or unique terms you encounter across dozens of hours. There really should be, but it is a story I nonetheless enjoyed trying to piece together for myself. I look forward to supplementing that knowledge with the inevitable painstakingly detailed lore videos that emerge from the community later. </p>
  <p>It ended up being the organic side stories that kept me most enthralled rather than the grand overarching plot that credits Game of Thrones’ George R.R. Martin as its scenario writer. FromSoft smartly doesn’t change much in its approach to these from the Souls games, Bloodborne, or Sekiro; you’ll just naturally meet characters as you explore and discover the world and become involved in their problems. There are no “!” markers on the map, no waypoints to guide you to them, and these characters don’t always flag you down or initially want or need anything from you. They’re just people with their own agendas and goals, whose stories are impacted based on your own actions or inactions. </p>
  <p>That was actually kind of refreshing in an open world as vast as this one, and it was always exciting to see a familiar face pop up again later as I was eager to learn about what brought them to this new part of the world and how their journey had progressed. The trade-off, of course, is that without any markers, quest log, or journal, it becomes very easy to forget about certain plot threads and accidentally leave them unresolved by the end. That’s a bummer, and I’ve already felt regret at missing out on stories that some of my colleagues have had – but for me it was worth it, because even after 87 hours, I never once felt the open-world fatigue that usually sets in when my brain gets overloaded by a map absolutely full of unresolved sidequest markers. Besides, any missed quests give me extra incentive to continue onto New Game+. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>“Freedom” is the word that every aspect of Elden Ring’s design connects back to. From the moment you set foot in <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/West_Limgrave_-_Dungeons,_Points_of_Interest,_and_Secrets">Limgrave</a>, the first of many interconnected regions of The Lands Between, you are completely free to go wherever you want. And sure, that’s far from a new concept in open-world games, but the way it''s handled here is truly extraordinary. If you wanted to, you could be an explorer and spend hours upon hours in Limgrave, delving into <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/Limgrave_Dungeons">every mini dungeon</a>, fighting <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/Boss_Guides">every boss</a>, discovering every NPC, and leveling yourself up to better prepare for what’s next. Alternatively, you could follow the Light of Grace, guiding you toward the main path and the first major dungeon – or you could find a hidden path to a new region that’s meant for higher levels and completely bypass the first major dungeon entirely! Maybe even steal yourself a cool weapon early while you’re there. </p>
  <p>Again, this is not unprecedented, but a few things set Elden Ring apart from games like Skyrim that provide a similar openness. For one, Elden Ring doesn’t scale enemy levels to match your own at all, so jumping into a later region means you’re always dealing with stronger enemies, making the risk/reward prospect of doing so very real. But perhaps more notably, the way its different areas are connected makes finding these new ones more than a simple matter of choosing a direction and heading towards it. Limgrave is designed very specifically with a main path in mind that takes you through <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/Stormveil_Castle">Stormveil Castle</a>, and finding a way around that truly feels like you’ve discovered a hidden passage or alternate route, which is a super cool feeling not present in most open worlds I’ve explored. </p>
  <p>You also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous FromSoft game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here. Stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch-walking, which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit; there’s now horseback combat in large, open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right-handed weapon, but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks; you can <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Craft_Items">craft items on the fly using materials found in the world</a> so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for; you can <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/List_of_Summonable_Spirit_Ashes">summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you</a>, each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages; and most substantially, you can e <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/Weapon_Skills_-_Ashes_of_War">quip Ashes of War to your weapons</a> and completely change their affinity and skill. </p>
  <p>The Ashes of War system essentially combines two elements of prior Souls games – weapon affinities and weapon skills – by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments. For example, let’s say I find a really good rapier and I really like the moveset, but I’m building my character with a focus on the Intelligence stat, which means it won’t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon. If I find an Art of War that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon, I can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon, thereby giving it Intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the Ash of War has. Best of all, if I eventually decide to <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Respec_Your_Character">respec into a different build</a>, I can still keep the same weapon and just put a different Ash of War onto it. Of course, you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities, but it''s nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons. </p>
  <p>The most important element of Elden Ring’s philosophy, though, is the freedom to just walk away and do something else when you hit a wall. Elden Ring is hard – which is to be expected from a FromSoft game – but its difficulty surprised me, even as a veteran of the Soulslike genre. I hit multiple points, even all the way up until the moment when I reached the very last boss, where I’d unlocked paths to several bosses and simply could not make headway on any of them. But even though I hit dead ends on those paths, there was always somewhere else I could go – a region I hadn’t thoroughly explored, an <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/Side_Quests_-_NPC_Character_Questlines">NPC quest</a> that I had set aside for later, a Light of Grace indicator that I had not yet followed. There was never a point in Elden Ring when I was at a complete loss of what to do, and every time I explored those other regions and followed those alternate paths I would find new gear and items, level up my stats, or learn new spells or skills that would eventually give me the extra edge I needed to power through a boss that had given me problems. </p>
  <p>It isn’t just the promise of making my numbers go up that called me to turn over every stone on the map: The Lands Between is positively brimming with riches, intrigue, and danger at every turn. Much of what Elden Ring’s open world does well can be traced directly back to things that made Breath of the Wild stand out from the many open-world games that came before it. (The PC version of Elden Ring also unfortunately borrows some of Breath of the Wild’s stuttery framerate woes). It’s that same feeling of starting out in a world with little explicit guidance, finding something that piques your curiosity on your own, doing whatever it takes to get there, and then being rewarded for that curiosity. </p>
  <p>The big difference is that in Breath of the Wild I could usually predict what’s going to happen when I get to that orange glowy thing off in the distance. I’ll do a puzzle, unearth a shrine, do another puzzle, and probably get a cool temporary weapon and a spirit orb. That’s not to take anything away from Breath of the Wild – it was awesome, but that pattern became somewhat routine well before the end. In Elden Ring, by contrast, very rarely did my predictions come true. I’d head to a lake and all of a sudden get ambushed by a dragon, follow a river expecting to collect some minor crafting materials only to find a dungeon filled with enemies and traps, enter a cave and get ambushed by little goblin men, or take a seemingly unimposing elevator and find that it just keeps going down further and further and further… until eventually I found myself not in a small dungeon but one of its many awe-inspiring new regions. </p>
  <p>Best of all, each of these little excursions rewards your curiosity with something worthwhile. That could be a new weapon, a new Ash of War, a valuable consumable, a new creature for you to summon, a new spell, or a new NPC to talk to. There are so many valuable rewards available that I never felt disappointed by my prize, regardless of the amount of effort it took. </p>
  <p>FromSoftware makes all of this especially painless thanks to a number of uncharacteristically friendly features. There’s a generous <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Fast_Travel">fast-travel system</a> with a ton of points strewn all across the map; a marker system that lets you drop points on the map to denote things like NPCs, boss locations, out-of-reach treasure, materials, and more; and a speedy spectral horse named Torrent that allows you to quickly cover ground and easily mount and dismount as the situation requires. </p>
  <p>But the thing that’s most impressive about Elden Ring is that, in between all of this brilliant open world design, there are also a handful of <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/Dungeons">Legacy Dungeons</a> that still deliver those “wide linear” levels that Souls fans have come to expect. These are gigantic castles, forts, manors, underground labyrinths, and more that are packed with secret areas, challenging bosses, and multiple paths that are linked via one-way shortcut doors. If they were strung all together without being tied to an open world, they could probably exist on their own as Dark Souls 4. </p>
  <p>Bottom line: Elden Ring’s open-world exploration is a new benchmark. It’s constantly exciting, rewarding, and full of moments that made me go “Holy shit” in a host of different ways. </p>
  <p>As far as combat goes, Elden Ring is certainly closest to Dark Souls 3 when compared to other games in FromSoftware’s library of action-RPGs, characterized by weighty attacks, careful stamina management, and a bit of a slower pace than games like Bloodborne and Sekiro. The two big new additions are the ability to use a guard counter by blocking an attack with your shield and immediately pressing the strong attack button to follow up with a crushing strike that can leave weaker enemies in a crumpled state, and a jump attack which gives melee weapon wielders a new type of heavy attack that can also be used to stun enemies and leave them open for a critical hit. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>They’re both great additions that offer melee <a href="/wikis/elden-ring/Classes">classes</a> fun new tools, but for the most part, FromSoftware has certainly adopted an “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach. What really makes the combat in Elden Ring so good though is its enemy design and variety. Not only are a fair number of them horrifying (not quite up to Bloodborne levels of grotesquerie, but still some weapons-grade nightmare fuel) but some of these baddies are absolutely vicious, coming at you with wild swings and combos that seemingly go on forever and can hit from 10 feet away. Others are more methodical and hide behind their shields to wait for the right opportunity to either parry you or catch you while you’re winding up. Others still are weak, but can be huge threats when they ambush you with a grab that kills in one hit. Many are designed to punish those who just mash the dodge-roll button without care, which makes Elden Ring a very hard game, but it’s a good style of difficulty; one that’s less about fast reaction speeds and twitch reflexes (though those certainly help) and more about learning, adapting, and finding the planted weaknesses in an enemy’s attack patterns. Deciphering those tells and acting upon each moment of opportunity is a large part of why these games are so much fun. </p>
  <p>And then there are the bosses. I don’t want to spoil them, but there are a handful that are some of the most visually and mechanically impressive FromSoftware has ever crafted. Some of the later ones got <em>really</em> close to crossing the line in terms of what I’d deem fair and reasonable when it comes to life-restoring second phases after already brutally tough first phases and two or three-against-one handicap battles, but fortunately, as mentioned before, any walls I hit were surmountable once I took the time to do something else and come back stronger. </p>',

'Hogwarts Legacy PS4 and Xbox One Versions Delayed for ''Best Possible Experience', 
' <img src="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/e5/4d/e54d4a36-75a4-481d-936d-47956fc448b9.jpg">
  <p>While Hogwarts Legacy has been out for some time on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, it has been delayed once more on PS4 and Xbox One to May 5, 2023.</p>

  <p>The news was shared on <a href="https://twitter.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/1632790738437013506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogwarts Legacy''s Twitter account</a> and it was confirmed that the original April 4 date for PS4 and Xbox One was just not enough time for the team to deliver the "best possible experience." </p>
  <p>"We’re overwhelmed with gratitude for the response to Hogwarts Legacy from fans around the globe," Hogwarts Legacy''s Twitter wrote. "The team is working hard to deliver the best possible experience on all platforms and we need more time to do this. Hogwarts Legacy will launch for PS4 and Xbox One May 5, 2023."</p>
  <p>There was no mention of the Nintendo Switch version in this post, so it appears <a href="/articles/hogwarts-legacy-delayed-on-playstation-4-and-xbox-one">it is still on track to be released on July 25, 2023.</a>
  </p>
  <p>In our <a href="/articles/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-ps5-xbox-pc">Hogwarts Legacy review,</a> we said, in "nearly every way," it is "the Harry Potter RPG I’ve always wanted to play." However, we did note it was "certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn’t come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me." It''s possible these technical issues were a bigger issue on last-gen hardware. </p>
  <p>Since it was released on February 10, <a href="/articles/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-sales">Hogwarts Legacy has sold over 12 million units</a> and has become the biggest launch ever for Warner Bros. Games. Despite the success, developer Avalanche Software recently told IGN that <a href="/articles/hogwarts-legacy-developer-confirms-there-are-no-current-plans-for-dlc">there are no plans for DLC for their Wizarding World RPG.</a></p>',

	'<p>Somerville - the new game from Limbo and Inside co-creator Dino Patti''s new studio - will be released on November 15 for PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be included on Xbox Game Pass upon release.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The studio revealed the launch date in a new, but rather low-key trailer. Somerville is a third-person adventure game following a family of four on a post-apocalyptic Earth. The father, mother, son, and dog must navigate around obstacles like ancient civilization ruins and mysterious aliens. Players must also work with other human survivors in order to keep the family safe.</p>
	<p>Somerville was first revealed in 2017 with a teaser trailer, followed by an announcement trailer at E3 2021. Now, it’ll finally release in a few short weeks. </p>
	<p>Jumpship was founded by Dino Patti, one of the co-founders of Playdead, which developed the independently successful Limbo and Inside. Patti left Playdead back in 2016 as he sought new challenges. However, he later revealed that there was also fallout within the studio and that he had personal reasons for leaving as well. </p>

	'Obsidian''s Pentiment Arrives This November',
	'<p>Obsidian Entertainment has announced that its narrative mystery game Pentiment will be released for Xbox One, Xbox Series, and PC on November 15.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Announced on Xbox Wire, the game was already confirmed for November but has now received an official date. Its announcement to release period is therefore fairly slim as Pentiment was only announced a couple of months ago in June. </p>
	<p>Led by industry veteran Josh Sawyer, the game follows a medieval artist named Andreas Maler, an educated journeyman who''s close to reaching his ultimate goal of becoming a master artist. As it happens, however, Maler gets caught up in a murder mystery as his friend is accused of killing someone.</p>
	<img src="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/thumbs/userUploaded/2022/6/13/pentiment-1655057026218.jpg">
	<p>The player, as Maler, must solve the mystery - or at least decide who''s punished - but Pentiment won''t make clear exactly who''s guilty. The decision will have knock-on effects over years and years as Maler gets caught up in more and more murders.</p>
	<p>Player choice is a staple in Obsidian Games - the developer behind Outer Worlds and Fallout: New Vegas - and Sawyer told IGN back in June that these themes would echo throughout Pentiment as well. </p>
	<p>"There will be familiar elements in terms of choice and background development and consequence for people who like our RPGs," he said. "But it really, at its heart, is a narrative adventure story."</p>

	'Somerville Review',
	'<p>Somerville is a delightfully bizarre, physics-based puzzle adventure game that was developed by a team that included the executive producer of Playdead’s pair of modern classics: Limbo and Inside. And yet at the same time it plays very differently from those offerings, reminding me more of the seminal early-’90s classic Out of This World than Limbo or Inside with its upside-down setting, its color palette and character renderings, and its ever-rotating camera orientation from scene to scene. This was a pleasant surprise, though it isn’t nearly as polished or thought-provoking as its progenitors, leaving us with a very good game but ultimately not one I expect to be thinking about for very long now that I’ve finished it.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Somerville opens in the most wholesome way possible: A man, a woman, their infant child, and their dog are all on the living room couch, having fallen asleep in front of the TV. You take control of the man, who is never named. In fact, we never hear from him or from anyone else. Like Limbo, Inside, and Out of This World, there is no dialogue; Somerville’s storytelling is entirely visual. And visually, I do love what developer Jumpship has done here. Our nameless, voiceless hero is also essentially faceless, since all of these characters are more like impressionist renderings of people. And yet the use of color – and particularly contrast – makes the world pop when need be, such as when a dash of yellow wordlessly tells you that you can interact with an object.</p>
    <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/12/10/screenshot-1-1639102182109.jpg">
	<p>Sound design, meanwhile, is effective in its minimalism. Aside from the piano soundtrack that’s good at nudging up the drama or tension when Somerville’s designers want it to, the pervading audio you’ll hear is the pained breathing and movement of our hero. Whatever happened to him clearly physically hurts him, and the further into this strange new world he gets, the more pain he’s in. </p>
    <p>All of this paints a very dark, bleak, and yet intriguing mystery – one where the story wastes no time in ratcheting up the danger with extraterrestrial objects suddenly filling the sky outside of your remote cabin in the opening moments and, well, it only gets mesmerizingly weirder from there. </p>
	<p>Somerville, then, is a slightly-under-four-hour quest to unravel what the hell just happened and is very much still happening. You’ll need to solve physics-based puzzles using your inexplicably glowing arm’s newfound power – primarily through turning the invading alien architecture into a permeable, water-like substance by shining light on it; specifically, light that’s been supercharged by your arm’s power. Extra layers get added to these powers as you progress, but it’s a bit thin; while it was enough gameplay to keep Somerville out of walking simulator territory, its puzzles aren’t likely to hold you up for more than a few moments at a time. In fact, the one time I did get hung up, it was more of an issue I had wrestling with the physics system than the actual game design.</p>
	<p>Part of the reason its puzzles never get all that complex is that Somerville keeps its control scheme minimalist: the triggers and one face button are all you’ll ever need. I admire that simplicity – including in the way it keeps its interface nonexistent 99% of the time. Especially in a moody adventure like this, I love when the atmospheric world gets to shine through unobstructed. </p>
	<h2>An Imperfect World</h2>
	<p>As a dog lover I was delighted at first by the prospect of having a four-legged wingman, but sadly, your canine companion serves almost no purpose here aside from occasionally and subtly pointing you in the right direction. He doesn’t assist in puzzles or gameplay, he has no impact on the story, and you can’t even pet him at will. There’s value in some companionship in such a lonely world, but it seems like he could’ve been given something more to do.</p>
	<p>Lonely and isolating as it may be, the altered Earth is, again, pretty. It’s also refreshing to be able to move about freely in each scene’s 3D space, which Somerville mixes up constantly. This is not a left-to-right stage progression; you’ll go up, down, left, and right at various times, and in that respect Somerville does a great job of staving off anything remotely resembling monotony during its short run. That’s a big part of where the aforementioned Out of This World reminder stems from, which was very much a good thing. And like that gem, I was always intrigued by where Somerville’s next scene might take me. </p>
	<p>Occasionally, though, that freedom results in awkward transitions when you move from one room to the next. Sometimes the room you’re heading into will have a different camera angle that causes you to move in the opposite direction, right back where you just came from, which never ceases to be annoying. </p>
	<p>When I made it through, though, I found a conclusion to the story that left me with far more questions than answers as I watched the end credits roll, and I have to admit with some disappointment that I didn’t immediately feel compelled to gather around the nearest water cooler to discuss those questions with friends. It’s difficult to describe without spoiling anything, but I suppose I’d say that I didn’t find Somerville’s mystery as alluring as I’d hoped. </p>',

	'Pentiment Review',
	'<p>It''s been an age since I felt so captivated by such a simple adventure game as Pentiment. A rousing, steadily-paced detective thriller set in the Late Medieval Bavarian countryside, the storybook art style inspired by colorful manuscripts of the era is downright enthralling. While the gameplay basically consists of looking around for clues, questioning townsfolk, and trying to draw your own conclusions about the evidence you find, that minimalist approach works excellently for the rich and complex story Pentiment tells.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Our inquisitive lead is Andeas Maler, initially an idealistic aspiring artist who comes to the picturesque, rustic town of Tassing to further his career in the nearby abbey''s scriptorium. He quickly becomes embroiled in a macabre conspiracy that delves into the town''s shrouded past, enticing you to uncover secrets many would rather keep buried. You get to define a lot of elements of Andreas'' backstory, such as where and what he studied, which I really enjoyed and adds an element of replayability. Having a university degree in theology helped a lot when pesky monks and nuns tried to quote the Bible at me to get their way and I was able to do so right back. But my background choices didn''t open up new paths quite as much as I would have liked, with their impact on a conversation most often boiling down to some different options for flavor text.</p>
    <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/14/pentimentinline3-d0d419bc72e6dad39134-1655166086538.jpg">
	<p>Thankfully, there aren''t many unintuitive puzzles in the traditional adventure game sense where you have to find bits and bobs out in the world and combine them to make a key. So the challenge of each mystery is talking to the right people, convincing them to tell you what you know, checking their story against others you''ve heard, and perhaps most importantly, using your time wisely. When you commit to pursuing a particular lead, time will advance, and you''re never given enough time to pursue them all. This added some welcome tension and forced me to make a lot of interesting decisions. I look forward to going back and finding out what I missed on future playthroughs.</p>
	<p>The town of Tassing and its surroundings are brought to life with a cohesive, beautiful, somewhat minimalist art style that takes inspiration from the very same period-accurate illustrations Andreas himself is working on. Sprawling fields, magnificent churches, and even secret crypts radiate color, life, and personality. Even the text boxes feature a variety of beautiful scripts that vary based on a person''s social class, with flowing handwriting for peasants and sanctimonious blackletter script for members of the church.</p>
	<p>The sound design is excellent, as well. The ambience of the village square or the relative quiet of a monastery during prayer is subtle, but highly effective at conveying a sense of place. And I''m not normally one for the whole ASMR thing, but there''s something about that noise of a pen scratching across vellum when characters are talking that gives me goosebumps. I feel like I could listen to it all day. The soundtrack, likewise, transported me to the Middle Ages with its traditional melodies and period-accurate instruments.</p>
	<p>The whole production really feels like a love letter from some serious Medieval history fans to all the like-minded players such as myself. Debating the writings of Christine de Pizan, discovering a certain character''s entanglements with the Fugger Bank, or even having a "What would Socrates do?" option in certain dialogues might be lost on many, but they made me grin with joy. Far from a pop culture caricature, it''s very clear that developer Obsidian Entertainment did a lot of research into the daily lives, theology, and sociology of the Holy Roman Empire in the 1500s. I practically gasped when I realized a folktale told by some of the townsfolk was a bastardization of a battle that took place near here during the Roman era. Every step of the way, I felt like I was geeking out about one of my special interests alongside the writers and artists.</p>
	<p>The dialogue and character writing are exceptional and effective, as well. Andreas himself is a complex character who changes significantly across the snapshots of his life we get to join him on. Pentiment''s world is one of heartbreaking personal tragedy, complex moral dilemmas, harrowing secrets, and the search for a purpose, with a huge cast of memorable characters who evolve alongside the town – partly based on decisions you get to make. And none of those decisions are easy. I never hit a point where I knew exactly what had happened, who was to blame, and that they definitely deserved to be punished by the proper authorities. Often, the best you can do is to decide on what course of action is the least of several evils.</p>
	<p>I also really enjoyed how snappy and fast-paced the dialogue is. It''s very easy for this type of game to be verbose and overwhelming. You only need to look to Obsidian''s own games for an example of how dumping way too much text on players at once can throw a wet blanket on a swashbuckling adventure. Pentiment wisely gets away from that tendency, with flavorful back-and-forths in which each character only speaks a sentence or two at a time. Journal entries about important people and world concepts are also tactfully brief. You''re never expected to spend several minutes reading to understand what''s going on. </p>',

'Resident Evil Village Review',
'Viva Las Plagas.',
'<p>n light of the high-quality remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 released in 2019 and 2020, it felt like a safe bet that Capcom would do an equally admirable job of rebuilding Resident Evil 4. Even so, when I hit the start button on this 2023 remake of the legendary 2005 action-horror game I wasn’t prepared for how forcefully it would knock my knees out from under me and suplex me headfirst into 16 hours of sustained tension and exhilaration. This fully revitalised campaign dramatically one-ups the original in almost every conceivable way. Its Spanish countryside setting is substantially more sinister, its pacing has been tightened to the point where hardly a single minute is wasted, and its controls have been modernised in order to allow its signature dynamic shooting mechanics to really shine. I’ve been waiting 18 years for a game to thrill me in the same way as Resident Evil 4; as it turns out, this whole time I’ve just been waiting for another Resident Evil 4.</p>
<P>The original Resident Evil 4 is a landmark installment in Capcom’s seminal survival-horror series that, for many, would need no introduction. However, considering it came out back when we assumed that Episode III would be the last Star Wars film and iPhones didn’t even exist yet, I should probably give it some context. At the time it was a big deal for Resident Evil to switch from the series’ traditional fixed-camera perspectives to a then radical over-the-shoulder viewpoint that brought us uncomfortably close to the gore and put the emphasis on reflexes and precision targeting, and as a result Resident Evil 4 was an action-horror epic without peer. Its influence has subsequently been felt in countless other third-person classics like Gears of War, Dead Space, and The Last of Us, and now its original DNA has been extracted, synthesised, and injected into a state-of-the-art host game, mutating it into a menacing new monster that’s breathtaking to behold and immensely intimidating to encounter.</P>
<h2>Sight for Saw Guys</h2>
<p>Thankfully, those days are gone. Not unlike the recent Metroid Prime Remastered, this Resident Evil 4 remake plays like a 2023 game. Luxuries like simultaneous twin-stick movement and targeting mean that you can cautiously back away while still keeping your gun trained on the advancing hordes, or side-step out of the way of an incoming crossbow bolt without having to remove your eye from the scope of your rifle. This newfound freedom of movement makes you better equipped to really make the most of the immensely satisfying area-specific damage effects; blowing kneecaps out to expose an enemy to a melee finisher, blasting sticks of dynamite held in the hands of attackers before they have a chance to throw them, or simply reveling in some of the grisliest headshots in the history of video game shotguns.</p>
<h2>Spanish Castle Magic</h2>
<p>Many of you under 30 might have no clue what Resident Evil 4 is about: it’s perhaps best described as riding a rollercoaster that’s careening off the rails to crash through a row of spectacular haunted houses. What starts as a fairly straightforward rescue mission, with Leon sent into a small Spanish village in search of the US President’s missing daughter Ashley, soon hurtles into a heart-stopping series of battles against giant sea monsters and towering trolls, desperate defenses against crazed hordes in boarded up cabins, outrageous assaults on a heavily fortified castle, skulking sections through shadowy laboratories, explosive minecart chases, and countless run-ins with some truly twisted freaks infected with the mutating Las Plagas parasite, all of which look consistently incredible reimagined on Capcom’s RE Engine (which also powered the last two remakes). The original RE4’s famously flabby final third has been tightened up considerably, and it all builds towards an improved and genuinely imposing final boss fight that took all of my skill and ammo reserves to topple.</p>
<p>Of equal importance to its renovated environments and enemies is the anxiety-inducing audio design. It can’t be overstated how effective the sounds of Resident Evil 4 are when it comes to cultivating a genuine sense of dread. Whether it’s the manic chanting of its parasite-riddled peasant farmers when you enter a new area, the snarl of wolves as they whip through the leaves around you in the castle’s hedge maze, or the throaty rumble of a chainsaw motor idling in the distance, just listening to it all routinely had me inching towards the edge of my seat in anticipation for each enemy encounter, so when the the carnage kicked off and the tension spiked I had hardly any couch left to cling to.</p>
<h2>Stranger’s Things</h2>
<p>When you do need to take a breather, the mysterious merchant returns to keep Leon topped up with a suite of dangerous devices like a quaint form of Q Branch, along with new recipes that allow you to craft the exact ammo types you want when out in the world rather than having to rely on randomised drops. He also pays the bounties on the optional side quests that have been added throughout the campaign, like shooting down hidden blue medallions or tracking down a rare golden chicken egg, which proved to be fun little diversions away from the story’s murderous main path. These bounties are paid in spinel gemstones which can be traded for unique items and upgrades outside of his standard inventory of wares, so although I was initially sad to see the iconic red dot sight removed from Leon’s starting pistol, it only took me a few short quests to be able to buy one and satisfyingly fit it myself.</p>
<p>One thing in particular that I appreciate about the remake’s merchant is that he’s a lot more generous when it comes to the trade-in value of your weapons. In the original it never really made sense to invest too heavily in upgrading the base pistol and shotgun early on, only for their value to drop dramatically when it came time to trade up for some beefier boomsticks. However, in the remake you’re effectively refunded close to the full value of each weapon along with the cost of any upgrades you’ve added to it, so you can re-spec your favourite guns and boost them towards their optimal forms without copping as big a penalty to your purse of Spanish pesetas.</p>
<p>The merchant also gives you access to the new bolt thrower weapon during your first encounter, and its reusable bolts come in handy in the story’s early hours when you’re still finding your feet as far as managing ammunition reserves and crafting resources goes. Yet despite his generous prices and fabulous wares, I couldn’t help but feel a little shortchanged after each transaction; his re-recorded dialogue isn’t delivered with quite the same kind of goofy charm as that of the grizzled original. However, in the scheme of things it says a lot for the overall quality of this remake when the only minor black mark I can give it is for its slightly blander black market dealer – and if this is your first time playing it won’t bother you in the slightest.</P>',

'The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR Review',
'Ride for your life.',
'
<p>I’m not exactly sure why a developer best known for quiet, choice-filled games that border on interactive movies is so interested in turning them into arcade-style rail shooters, but Supermassive Games is taking another crack at exactly that – this time with the help of the new PlayStation VR2 headset. Like Until Dawn: Rush of Blood before it, The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR focuses less on storytelling and more on action to mixed results. While it’s fun to blast through ghouls and bats in my path, this spinoff is plagued by many of the same issues as its predecessor, including a disappointingly short runtime.</p>
<p>Switchback VR’s story feels like an afterthought, putting you in the role of an unnamed protagonist on a hellish rollercoaster ride across ten different stages. Most are locations featured in the first season of The Dark Pictures Anthology, but you’re never really told much about why the protagonist is visiting them or any of the few supporting characters they meet. That’s partially because Switchback VR is very short, only taking me about four hours to complete, but it’s disappointing all the same, given how good of a job Supermassive usually does providing backstory and depth to its characters.</p>
<p>But what it lacks in story, Switchback VR mostly makes up for in gameplay. While the on-rails nature of its action naturally limits where you can go, you are able to move your head to look around in any direction in VR. It was fun to quickly turn each time I heard eerie screams or enemies creeping up on me in the background or occasionally having to physically duck to avoid falling beams and leaning pillars. That situational awareness is key as enemies will sometimes sneakily appear to the left and right of your peripheral vision.</p>
<h2>Shooting feels responsive and the motion-controlled aiming is very accurate.</h2>
<p>The shooting mechanics themselves have been simplified for VR, with firing and reloading both mapped to two buttons on each Sense controller since so few are needed overall. That’s not a bad thing as on-rail shooters focus more on throwing as many enemies at you as possible in a short period of time than nuanced gunplay. Still, shooting in Switchback VR feels responsive and the motion-controlled aiming is very accurate, which made headshots extremely rewarding each time I pulled one off.</p>
<p>The heads you’ll be popping vary depending on the stage you’re on, ranging from standard zombies to flying vampires. Most of these enemies will be familiar to those that played any of the first season of The Dark Pictures Anthology, each a faithful recreation of the monsters from those games. Killing enemies or destroying inanimate objects such as bottles, empty crates, and skulls will increase your score for a level, which is a nice incentive to deal as much damage as you can. There are even local and online leaderboards for you to compare scores with other players, but it feels like a shallow exercise when they don’t measure important factors like accuracy.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR is a fun on-rails arcade shooter, even if it’s one that takes less than a day to complete. It’s also one of the first games in the PS VR2’s library to really take advantage of the headset’s eye-tracking tech in an interesting and exciting way. However, the lack of scares, weak story, and occasional performance issues keep it from being a must-buy for PS VR2 early adopters.</p>',

'<p>Destiny 2 players have been gathering en masse at the Tower to honor the late Lance Reddick, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollywood-and-the-games-industry-pay-tribute-to-lance-reddick-we-just-lost-a-beautiful-human">who passed away yesterday at the age of 60</a>.</p>
<P>After the news broke yesterday, Guardians began flocking to Commander Zavala, who Reddick famously voiced, to pay their respects. News traveled quickly in the Destiny community as Reddick was not only an avid fan of Destiny, but would occasionally engage with players on social media as Commander Zavala.</P>

<p>Although it’s a bit quieter in the Tower today, just about every instance had Guardians standing stoically in a circle around Zavala yesterday using the "Humanity’s Sheild" emote to signify his character’s larger-than-life presence, or sitting amongst their fellow Guardians while attending a impromptu candlelight vigil.</p>
<p>Over on the /r/DestinyTheGame subreddit, the post honoring Reddick quickly rose to become the 2nd most popular post across all of Reddit, with plenty of community members and former Bungie developers sharing their favorite memories of Zavala, or Reddick himself.</p>
<p>Reddick’s passing hit especially close to home for Guardians, as they’ve spent the past nine years alongside his character in-game. As I popped into various livestreams on Twitch yesterday, it seemed like it was all people were talking about. Likewise on Twitter, where just about everyone in the Destiny community was sharing screenshots of the Tower, or posting videos showcasing all the Guardians that had gathered to pay tribute to Zavala.</p>
<p>Stephanie Reddick, Lance’s wife, posted a message on his Twitter account to address his sudden passing. She also acknowledged the Destiny community by saying, "...to the thousands of Destiny players who played in special tribute to Lance, thank you. Lance loved you as much as he loved the game."</p>
<p>Bungie also put out an official statement following the news stating that "Lance Reddick was an iconic presence on screen, in Destiny, and most importantly, in person. His love for our community shined through in Commander Zavala, in his uncompromising dedication to his craft, and out of the radiating kindness that touched those around him. To say he will be missed is a profound understatement, yet no less true. Rest in peace, Lance."</P>',

'Breath of the Wild - 19 Fascinating Facts From The Game’s Development',
'We take a look back at just how different Breath of the Wild could have been.',
'<p>It’s been a full five years since Breath of the Wild was released on March 3, 2017, and we’re still entranced. Nintendo packed so many innovative ideas and small details into its open-world opus that new discoveries continue to be made almost every day. But how did the development team decide what Breath of the Wild should be like as an experience? Where did they draw their inspiration from? And how different could it have been? To find out, let’s go all the way back to the game’s development to revisit 19 fascinating facts that helped shaped this landmark game. Be sure to let us know in the comments how many of these you already knew, and also don’t miss out on the video version of this feature above!</p>
<h2>1) Breadth of the Wild Ideas</h2>
<p>The goal of Breath of the Wild was to "break the conventions of the Zelda series," and that was really taken to heart by the development team, who pitched all sorts of wild ideas early on in planning, from a Hyrule with invading UFOs that could abduct cattle, through to a guitar-wielding Link and motorbike-riding Link.</p>

<h2>2) Who’s The Boss?</h2>
<p>And that’s thanks, incidentally, to series producer Eiji Aonuma, who was the driving force behind the inclusion of the Master Cycle Zero in the game. In the must-read Creating a Champion book, he says he pitched the idea early on but was rebuffed, only to bring it up again later as the ideal reward for players who complete The Champions’ Ballad DLC. The staff were “pretty unenthusiastic,” according to Aonuma, but eventually “got into the idea”. I mean, it is a fun concept. And not without some precedent, either.</p>

<h2>3) A Link to the Past</h2>
<p>Early on in development, the team wanted an easy way to test - and illustrate - the interactions that they saw as the foundation of Breath of the Wild’s gameplay. To do this, they created a prototype that looks for all the world like a classic 2D Zelda game (albeit with a Link in blue instead of green), and used this to show how Link would be able to do things like shoot an arrow through a fire to set a bush on fire, or to use a Korok leaf to blow an enemy back. It was a hugely important step in assuring the team they were on the right path.</p>
<h2>4) Multiplicative Magic</h2>
<p>In fact, the interconnectivity between different systems became the core technological focus for Breath of the Wild. The philosophy was that by building connections between everything in the world, the gameplay possibilities would multiply. To realise this multiplicative gameplay concept, the team implemented a robust physics and chemistry engine, and really focused on making the interactions as intuitive as possible.</p>
<p>This gave players the opportunity to test things that made logical sense. Like, if Link gets struck by lightning during a thunderstorm because he has metal weapons equipped, does that mean that you can get enemies struck by lightning if you take their wooden one and drop a metal one for them? The answer in this specific instance is yes, but what makes Breath of the Wild so special is just how often the answer is yes across the board. The game offers unprecedented opportunities for player agency and creative thinking.</P>
<h2>5) It’s Elemental, My Dear</h2>
<p>It’s worth diving a little deeper into something I mentioned in the last point - the game’s chemistry engine. After all, in gaming we hear a lot about physics engines - which are concerned with movement, but Breath of the Wild’s team also formalised the idea of a chemistry engine - which is concerned with states. And this really is one of the game’s key underlying components. It’s called a chemistry engine, but it’s actually less about chemistry and more about elements - fire, water, ice, wind, electricity - and how they interact with both objects and one another. The idea of calling it a chemistry engine actually makes a lot of sense, however, when you consider that the development team described the multiplicative gameplay they were trying to create as ‘chemical reaction play’.</p>',
